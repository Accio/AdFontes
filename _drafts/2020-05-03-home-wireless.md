## Key learnings

* Setting up Wifi roaming is (almost) straight forward: set the same SSID as that of the router on the Access Point (AP), connect it via ethernet cable to the router, disable its DHCP, and set the AP according to the manual. It should work out of the box.
* On Access Point (AP), use a moderate Transmitter Power Control (or TX Power), and select a different WLAN signal channel from the router. Both measures help avoiding conflicts between signals.
* If the internet speed when using the wireless signal of AP is slower than the speed when using wireless of the router, the Ethernet connection speed may be a speed-limiting factor. This can happen, for instance, when the internet connection is better than the speed limit of the Ethernet connection. Check the specification of AP.
