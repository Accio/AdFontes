Recently, a PhD student asked me for advantages and disadvantages of doing a postdoc in a company compared with doing a postdoc in academia. Since the question may also interest other students or researchers who face the decision, I want to share my thoughts here.

I believe that it is worth doing a postdoc in industrial research, both professionally and personally. If you have the opportunity to work in a good team in a company that respects and rewards research, it can be a rewarding step in your career. 

I write this piece with quite some bias. I joined industry directly after PhD study, therefore I have never been a postdoc either in academia or in industry. I joined the company as a research scientist, who is supposed to support projects right away. I was very fortunate to work on a few questions that are more of a research nature, thanks to the visionary mentors and to the helpful team. Therefore, I cannot tell what it is like to be an industrial postdoc from my own perspective.

Apart from not joining the industry as a postdoc, I have only limited knowledge about postdocs in academia. My experience comes mostly from interactions with the researchers that I worked with before I joined industry, academic collaborators since then, and people who have done a academic postdoc and then joined industry. My experience with either academic or industrial postdoc positions is, therefore, second hand and incomplete at its best. 

On the other side, many postdoc fellows that I have worked with, either working in academia or in industry, have confided me with many thoughts, experience, and feelings. They shared both success stories and frustrations. It is my privilege to listen to and learn from so many enthusiastic, talented, and hard-working scientists. I feel obliged to synthesize my thoughts with their inputs on this topic and put them down.

# Benefits of doing a postdoc in industry

There are many reasons speaking for doing a postdoc in industry. Below are the ones that I found appealing to most people that I know.

Let us start with your long-term goal. If you can imagine putting your scientific and personal knowledge and skills in an industrial setting, doing a postdoc there is a good start. 

What happens if your answer to the question is 'I do not know'? This is okay. After all, many students have no or little experience with research in industry, unless they have worked there or have had academic-industrial collaborations. A postdoc, being a temporary position, offers people both an opportunity to get first-hand experience with industrial research and time to reflect and to take decisions. The only way to answer the question above is to give it a try. 

Then there are students who have long determined to apply their capacities in industry. The decision may base on various considerations: better working conditions in general, the direct impact of the work, more respect for work-life balance, less focus on paper writing and grant applications, *etc.*. For them, a postdoc position offers a reality check: are the working conditions indeed better? Is the expected impact reachable and accessible? Is the work-life balance really better than in the academia environment? Is one satisfied with the fact that not all findings can be shared with a wide community in a timely manner, at least not without legal and intellectual property (IP) considerations? The situation differs between companies and between research areas, and experience and impression of one postdoc may differ from that of another one. Working as an industrial postdoc can either confirm your idea or challenge it, enriching your experience in either way. It is like a honeymoon. One is (hopefully) still under hormones, but at least some unrealistic expectations will be smoothed out, while unexpected joy and frustrations may bring new insights.

Even if your long-term goal is to build your expertise and career in academia, a postdoc in industry may pay off in an unexpected manner. It can help you grasp a comprehensive view of the practical applications of your discipline, and its connections to other disciplines. In industrial research, the chance that one discipline generating all research products, which later translate into revenues and profits, dwindles to near zero. Take drug discovery as example: the list of disciplines that contribute to a new drug is long: biology, chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, molecular modelling, computational biology, bioinformatics, statistics, modelling and simulation, ... . As a postdoc in industry, you will for sure dive deep into your discipline. At the same time, you will be certainly exposed to other research areas that are at least as exciting, interesting, and important as your own field. Being informed about the existence and importance of related fields, and the unique contribution of own research, is an important plus for a postdoc position in industry. In a minimum, being informed about the state-of-the-art of your discipline and other disciplines helps one to identify significant questions that will have impacts, and to come up with solutions that are more likely to be practical and impactful. The success of many academic scholars who have had industrial working experience can tell that.

It is not to say that postdocs in academia are not informed about related fields. In contrast, quite a few interesting academic postdoc projects that I know are in fact the result of interdisciplinary collaboration. The major difference between industry and academia lies in the incentives: while industrial research puts investment return at the first place and therefore value practical innovations that may turn into revenue and profit, academic research is sometimes deemed as 'pure', driven primarily by curiosity interest, and awarded mainly by publications, grants, and permanent positions. Given that a complex product can hardly be delivered by experts from one discipline, whereas a immortal paper or an distinguishing career as a professor can thrive on deep work in one area, industrial research is born more interdisciplinary.

Besides as a means to achieve your long-term goal, working as a postdoc also creates, shapes, and expands your personal network. The postdoc contract has a end date, but the contact network persists when you leave the company, or even when you leave the field of science. This network, thanks to the interdisciplinary nature of industry, may consist of people of diverse types with regard to their nationality, educational background, and life philosophy. It may provide only limited help with regard to publications and grant applications, but does provide you an alternative view of work and life, which can be refreshing or thought-provoking.

# Considerations before committing to a postdoc position in industry

A postdoc in industry demands not only excellence in your own field. It also challenge you to communicate with experts from other fields and even to influence them. The goal is not confined to publish papers (which are often still desired) or to get grants (probably less so), but also to do convincing work that inspire others - not only your peers, but also experts in other fields, including scientists and managers. Under circumstances, it is even important to convince investors, which happens more often in a smaller company than a bigger one. Are you a computational biologist? Okay, you do not stop when you develop a new algorithm or model to explain things. You strive to make predictions that wet-lab biologists and chemists that can test. Are you a biologist? Your goal is not only to describe and explain what you observe, but also to put that into the disease context and to suggest new therapies. And so on. In this process, you the postdoc will inevitably interact with experts from other domains, explain them why your work matters, and persuade them why money should be put on the table to test your hypothesis. In a way, a postdoc challenges a scientist more: besides being good (and more than that!) in your field and influence it, you have to interact with people from other fields, learn from them, and influence them. That can be quite a challenge, especially for graduate students, many of whom are trained to work in a different way. 

Again, this does imply that academic postdocs only focus on their own fields of research. Quite on the opposite, I personally know quite a few outstanding postdocs that outreach and collaborate beyond boundaries, who have a great impact in and beyond their field of research. I have little doubt that many of them can would do a great job in industry as well if they wish so and if they are given the chance. For newly graduated students, though, I wish to explicitly state the responsibility of doing a postdoc in industry so that you are prepared.

Working with interdisciplinary teams may lead you to ask yourself: what is the point of going so deep in my field? Some people may answer: well, not that much. Other people will rather learn in the interaction exactly why their field is important, and get motivated to dive deeper. Yet other people will spot the needs and gaps on the interfaces between disciplines and develop new techniques, skills, and even new research areas - these people often become giants in the field. Learning how to constantly learn and apply new things, how to solve complex problems under practical constraints including time and budget, and how to being both an respectable scientist and a team player is utter important for postdocs in industry. If you take the challenge seriously, you will regularly ask yourself critically: does my research matter? Can I make it matter more? By asking these questions and searching for answers, I guess we may become better people and better scientists.

Besides scientific work, there is a social aspect of doing a postdoc in industry. In biology and relevant fields, many more researchers perform their postdoc work in academia than in industry. This may make it difficult for industrial postdocs to exchange experience and perspectives, both personal and scientific, with fellows. Luckily, though, there are more and more communities for postdocs and other junior researchers inside and between companies nowadays, so that an industrial postdoc does mean working in isolation. Nevertheless, more can done to promote scientific and personal exchange of industrial and academic postdocs.

I have met students who worry that their experience in industry may bring them unpleasant questions in future job interviews - 'Did you decide to join industry? Why do you now come back?'. I think there are two aspects here. In many cases, people are just curious - after all, we are scientists, who are at least defined by their curiosity. Some students worry that the questions are not free of a scrutinizing undertone. I do not know how often this happens. I believe, however, that a capable scientist is welcome anywhere, whether she or he has been exclusively in academia or has switched between the sides. 

# How should I decide?

You are welcome to expand the list of advantages and considerations above and modify it as you see fit. Use them to as information for decision making. Listen to yourself. Talk about your goals, wishes, questions, and worries with researchers with experience from either academia or industry. Make a decision. Go ahead. 

The postdoc is, after all, only one step in a long career. Even if it turns out to be a detour, you may take something useful and interesting from it. Much luck and success with your decision!
