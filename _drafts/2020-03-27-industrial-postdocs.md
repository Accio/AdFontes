Recently, a PhD student asked me for both advantages and disadvantages of doing a postdoc in a company compared with doing a postdoc in academia. Since the question may interest some other students or researchers who face the decision, I want to share my thoughts here.

I believe that it is worth to do a postdoc in industrial research, both professionally and personally. It can be rewarding step in your career. 

I write this piece with quite some bias. I joined industry directly after PhD study, therefore I have never been a postdoc either in academia or in industry. Though the first two years of my work in the industry is more of an exploratory nature, it was partly thanks to the vision that my mentors had and partly due to chance. After all, I was not hired as a postdoc and instead supposed to support projects right away. Even if I have been acquainted with industrial research early one and therefore can tell one or another story there, my knowledge about postdocs in academia is even more limited. My experience comes mostly from interactions with the researchers that I worked with before I joined industry, academic collaborators since then, and people who have done a academic postdoc and then joined industry. My experience with either academic or industrial postdoc positions is, therefore, second hand and incomplete at its best. 

On the other side, many postdoc fellows that I have collaborated with, either working in academia or in industry, have confided me with many thoughts, experience, and feelings. They told both success stories as well as shared some frustrations. It is my privilege to listen to and learn from so many enthusiastic, talented, and hard-working scientists. I feel obliged to synthesize my thoughts with their inputs on this topic and put them down.

# Benefits of doing a postdoc in industry

There are many reasons speaking for doing a postdoc in industry. Below are the ones that I found appealing to most people that I know.

Let us start with your long-term goal. If you can imagine putting your scientific and personal knowledge and skills in an industrial setting, doing a postdoc there is a good start. What happens if your answer to the question is 'I do not know'? This is okay. After all, most students have no or little experience with research in industry, unless they have worked in the industry or have had academic-industrial collaborations. A postdoc, being a temporary position, offers people both an opportunity to get first-hand experience with industrial research and time to take decisions. The only way to find the answer out to the question is to give it a try. 

Then there are students who have long determined to apply their abilities in industry. They may have made this decision based on experience or considerations: better working conditions in general, the impact that they may have, more respect for work-life balance, less focus on paper writing and grant applications, *etc.*. For them, a postdoc position offers a reality check of their ideals: are the working conditions indeed better? Is the expected impact reachable and accessible? Is the work-life balance really better than in the academia environment? Is one satisfied with the fact that not all finding can be shared with a wide community in a timely manner? These aspects vary between one company and another, and the experience of one person may differ from that of another one. Nevertheless, a postdoc in industry can either confirm your idea or challenge it, in either case enriching your experience. A postdoc in industry is not unlike a honeymoon: one is still under hormones, but at least quite some unrealistic expectations will be smoothed out, while unexpected joy and frustrations may bring new insights.

Even if your long-term goal is to build your expertise and career in an academic setting, you may consider a postdoc in industry. My understanding is that the postdoc experience in industry can help you to build a comprehensive view of the practical side of your discipline, and its connections to other disciplines. In industrial research, the chance that one discipline generating all research products, which later translate into revenues and profits, dwindles to near zero. Take drug discovery as example: the list of disciplines that contribute to a new drug is long: biology, chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, molecular modelling, computational biology, bioinformatics, statistics, modelling and simulation, ... . As a postdoc in industry, you will for sure dive deep into your discipline. At the same time, you will be certainly exposed to other aspects of research that are at least as exciting, interesting, and important as your own field. Being informed about the existence and importance of related fields, and the unique contribution of own research, is an important plus for a postdoc position in industry. In a minimum, being informed about the state-of-the-art of your discipline and other disciplines helps one to identify significant questions that will have impacts, and to come up with solutions that are more likely to be practical and impactful.

It is not to say that postdocs in academia are not informed about related fields. In contrast, quite a few interesting academic postdoc projects that I know are in fact the result of interdisciplinary collaboration. The major difference between industry and academia lies in the incentives: while industrial research puts investment return at the first place and therefore value practical innovations that may turn into revenue and profit, academic research is sometimes deemed as 'pure', driven by interest, and awarded mainly by publications, grants, and permanent positions. Given that a complex product can hardly be produced by experts from one discipline, whereas a immortal paper or an distinguishing career as a professor can thrive on deep work in one area, industrial research is born more interdisciplinary.

Besides as a means to achieve your long-term goal, working as a postdoc also creates, shapes, and expands your personal network. The postdoc contract may have a end date, but the contact network does not cease to exist when you leave the company, or even when you leave the field of science. While you can also build a powerful network in academia, the industrial network, thanks to the collaborative and interdisciplinary nature, may consist of more diverse types of people with regard to their nationality, educational background, and life philosophy. It needs to be superior to the academic network when it comes to rewards such as positions or publications, but may provide you an alternative view of work and life, which can be sometimes refreshing or thought-provoking.

# Considerations before committing to a postdoc position in industry

A postdoc in industry demands not only excellence in your own field. It also challenge you to communicate with experts from other fields and even to influence them. The goal is not confined to publish papers or to get grants, but also to do convincing work that inspire others - not only your peers, but also experts in other fields, including scientists, managers, or investors (which happens more often in a smaller company than a bigger one). Are you a computational biologist? Okay, you do not stop when you develop a new algorithm or model to explain things. You strive to make predictions that wet-lab biologists and chemists that can test. Are you a biologist? Your goal is not only to describe and explain what you observe, but also to put that into the disease context and to suggest new therapies. In this process, the postdoc will inevitably interact with experts from other domains, explain them why his or own work matters, and persuade them why money should be put on the table to test hypothesis. In a way, a postdoc challenges a scientist more: besides being good (and more than that!) in your field and influence it, you have to interact with people from other fields, learn from them, and influence them. That can be quite a challenge, especially for graduate students, many of whom are trained to work in a different way. 

Again, this does imply that academic postdocs only focus on their own fields of research. In start contrast, I personally know many outstanding postdocs that outreach and collaborate beyond boundaries, who have a great impact in and beyond their field of research. I have little doubt that many of them can do a great job in industry as well, if they are given the chance and if they wish so. For newly graduated students, though, I wish to explicitly share the responsibility of doing a postdoc in industry so that you are prepared.

Working with interdisciplinary teams may lead you to ask yourself: what is the point of going so deep in my field? Some people may answer: well, not that much. Other people will rather learn in the interaction exactly why their field is important, and therefore go deeper into it. Yet other people will spot the needs and gaps on the interfaces between subjects and develop new techniques, skills, and even disciplines - these often become giants in the field. Learning how to constantly learn new things, how to solve complex problems under practical constraints including time and budget, and how to being both an respectable scientist and a team player is utter important for postdocs in industry. If you take the challenge seriously, you will regularly ask yourself critically: does my research matter? Can I make it matter more? By asking these questions and searching for answers, I believe we become better people and better scientists.

Besides scientific work, there is a social aspect of doing a postdoc in industry. In most places, more researchers perform their postdoc work in academia than those in industry. This may make it difficult for industrial postdocs to exchange experience and perspectives, both personal and scientific, with fellows. Luckily, though, there are many communities of such postdocs inside and between companies nowadays so that an industrial postdoc does mean working in isolation. Nevertheless, more can done to promote scientific and personal exchange of industrial and academic postdocs.

I have met students who worry that their experience in industry may bring them unpleasant questions in future job interviews - 'Did you decide to join industry? Why do you now come back?'. I think there are two aspects here. In many cases, people are just curious - after all, we are scientists, who are at least defined by their curiosity. And I think it should be absolutely fine to state whatever you think. Some students worry that the questions are not free from a scrutinizing undertone. I do not know how often this happens. I believe, however, that a capable candidate is welcome anywhere, whether she or he has been exclusively in academia or has switched between the sides. 

# How should I decide?

You are welcome to expand the list of advantages of an industrial postdoc and considerations above, modify it as you see fit, and use the information to guide you to the decision. Listen to yourself. Talk about your goals, wishes, questions, and worries with researchers with experience from either academia or industry. Make a decision. Go ahead. 

The postdoc is, after all, only one step in a long career. Even if it turns out to be a detour, you may take something useful and interesting with you back from it.
