### Hill tail-index estimator and Hill equation

The Hill tail-index estimator was proposed by Bruce M. Hill as a simple and
general method to inference about the tail behaviour of a distribution ([Hill
*et al.*](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176343247)). It does not assume
any global form for the distribution function, but only the form of the behaviour
in the tail where it is desired to draw inference. It is a way to describe
[heavy-tailed
distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy-tailed_distribution#Hill's_tail-index_estimator),
besides Pickand's and Ratio estimators of the tail-index.

Do not mix it with the [Hill coefficient in Hill equation in
biochemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_equation_(biochemistry)), which
is attributed to the English physiologist [Archibald Vivian (A.V.)
Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Hill). As the Hill coefficient
increases, the saturation curve becomes steeper.
