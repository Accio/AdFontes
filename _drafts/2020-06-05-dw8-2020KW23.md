### Happiness and sadness, quantified

[Kettelwell *et
al.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319302204)
reported in *SSM - Population Health* a cohort study of impact of major life
events, such as marriage, money gain, widowing, and separation, on cognitive and
affective well-being.

In this study, *Cognitive well-being* refers to overall life satisfaction. It
was obtained from the annual face-to-face interview using the response to the
question: &ldquo;All things considered, how satisfied are you with your
life?&rdquo;. The respondent was asked to pick a number between 0 (not
satisfied) and 10 (satisfied).

*Affective well-being* refers to the frequency and intensity with which people
experience positive affect and negative affect. It was quantified by questions
about positive and negative aspects of mental health, such as &ldquo;felt so
down in the dumps nothing could cheer me up&rdquo;, &ldquo;been happy&rdquo;),
and questions dealing with positive and negative aspects of vitality (e.g.,
&ldquo;feel full of life&rdquo;, &ldquo;felt worn out&rdquo;).

Interesting findings: against common assumptions,
promotion and being fired had little, if any, independent effect on well being,
while other events such as financial loss, death of partner, and childbirth have
profound impacts. Either positive or negative, the effect of most events wane
after two to four years time.

I think we have to interpret the data cautiously. For instance, it was reported
that the death of friends, on average, has little effect. The effect, though,
may between friends dramatically, because &lsquo;friends&rsquo; is a broad
category of people that we interact with.

Nevertheless, the findings remind us how to make better decisions about what to
invest in and spend time on. Family members and other loved ones, wealth ([not
money or status](https://nav.al/rich)), and health would, not surprisingly,
enrich the life of most people.

### No bullshit design thinking

1. Listen to what people *want* and make customer become the *king*.
1. The team defines *together* before creating anything.
1. Gather *ideas* how to implement a minimalistic product.
1. Build a *prototype* to show it to the team members and the customer.
1. Make people *test* the prototype and *iterate* and *refine*.

The five steps are also known as *Empathize*, *Define*, *Ideate*, *Prototype*,
*Test*.
