Here are the things I discovered this week that fascinates me.

This week I recorded *Song at the Speyer Cathedral*, a piano solo piece composed David Nevue. I hope you enjoy it!

## Biology

### Lessons learned from the TRACERx study

I share my learning notes [in another blog post]({% post_url
2020-05-30-TRACERx-100 %}).

### Flagship studies of the Genome Aggregation Database (genomAD)

*Nature* and other journals published a series of studies reporting the results
of analysing the [Genome Aggregation Database (genomAD)](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html).

### RNA-guided endonucleases editting: decades of efforts tested in clinic

Bruce Sullenger published a brief review of the history and recent progress of
RNA-guided endonuclease (RGEN) editing of RNA and DNA, in particular its
application in the clinic.

### Happiness and sadness, quantified

[Kettelwell *et
al.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319302204)
reported in *SSM - Population Health* a cohort study of impact of major life
events, such as marriage, money gain, widowing, and separation, on cognitive and
affective well-being.

In this study, *Cognitive well-being* refers to overall life satisfaction. It
was obtained from the annual face-to-face interview using the response to the
question: &ldquo;All things considered, how satisfied are you with your
life?&rdquo;. The respondent was asked to pick a number between 0 (not
satisfied) and 10 (satisfied).

*Affective well-being* refers to the frequency and intensity with which people
experience positive affect and negative affect. It was quantified by questions
about positive and negative aspects of mental health, such as &ldquo;felt so
down in the dumps nothing could cheer me up&rdquo;, &ldquo;been happy&rdquo;),
and questions dealing with positive and negative aspects of vitality (e.g.,
&ldquo;feel full of life&rdquo;, &ldquo;felt worn out&rdquo;).

Interesting findings: against common assumptions,
promotion and being fired had little, if any, independent effect on well being,
while other events such as financial loss, death of partner, and childbirth have
profound impacts. Either positive or negative, the effect of most events wane
after two to four years time.

I think we have to interpret the data cautiously. For instance, it was reported
that the death of friends, on average, has little effect. The effect, though,
may between friends dramatically, because &lsquo;friends&rsquo; is a broad
category of people that we interact with.

Nevertheless, the findings remind us how to make better decisions about what to
invest in and spend time on. Family members and other loved ones, wealth ([not
money or status](https://nav.al/rich)), and health would, not surprisingly,
enrich the life of most people.

### No bullshit design thinking

1. Listen to what people *want* and make customer become the *king*.
1. The team defines *together* before creating anything.
1. Gather *ideas* how to implement a minimalistic product.
1. Build a *prototype* to show it to the team members and the customer.
1. Make people *test* the prototype and *iterate* and *refine*.

The five steps are also known as *Empathize*, *Define*, *Ideate*, *Prototype*,
*Test*.

### Music theory explained

I discovered videos of Karen Ramirez on YouTube, for instance [How to Make Chords from a Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt6zDOFNAdY) and [Chord Sequence 1 -6 -2 -5 -1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdCZwxpPEZg). 

Karen Ramirez is a fantastic teacher who knows how to bring messages over. She is knowledgeable, enthusiatic, and she speak directly and explains well. I am learning both music theory and teaching from her.

I created a [play list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzx9Jk87ZvDJxq3hxZ-Ju19n7oBxFmVyW) on YouTube that contains her videos that I still need to watch.

A related resource is a video (in Chinese) about the circle of fifth, which is available on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/s/video/BV1Hb411j7aX). The cool thing: even a JavaScript-implementation of the Circle of Fifths is introduced, withe source code available at GitHub [wiwikuan/wiwi-circleOfFifths](https://github.com/wiwikuan/wiwi-circleOfFifths).

### Core progress in AI has stalled in some fields

Hutson summarized in a short article the observation that [core progress in AI
has stalled in some fields](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-020-0066-y).
Examples include neural-network pruning algorithms, information retrieval
system, loss function in image retrieval, adversarial training with projected
gradient descent, long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and generative
adversarial networks (GANs).

My interpretation is that impactful innovation happens rarely. It can be sad and
frustrating for those who aim to develop a genuinely new algorithm that
transform how we analyse the data and the way we model the world. It can be
encouraging for those who wait a bit and use the best model available, which is
used by many but not all people, to get the best leverage of the technology.

I guess the return of investment of either following every new algorithm and
result, or not following any, is worse compared with the wait-observe-and-invest
approach.

## One final thing: new music sheet shared on MuseScore

I shared a new music sheet of an old German folklore, *Ich liebe den Frühling*
(I love the spring, 我爱春天) on
[MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/32500761/scores/6165050).
