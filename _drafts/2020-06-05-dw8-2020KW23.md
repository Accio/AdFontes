[Kettelwell *et
al.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319302204)
reported in *SSM - Population Health" a cohort study of impact of major life
events, such as marriage, money gain, widowing, and separation, on cognitive and
affective well-being.

Interesting findings: against common assumptions,
promotion and being fired had little, if any, independent effect on well being,
while other events such as financial loss, death of partner, and childbirth have
profound impacts. Either positive or negative, the effect of most events wane
after two to four years time.

I think we have to interpret the data cautiously. For instance, it was reported
that the death of friends, on average, has little effect. The effect, though,
may between friends dramatically, because &lsquo;friends&rsquo; is a broad
category of people that we interact with.

Nevertheless, the findings remind us how to make better decisions about what to
invest in and spend time on. Family members and other loved ones, wealth ([not
money or status](https://nav.al/rich)), and health would, not surprisingly,
enrich the life of most people.
