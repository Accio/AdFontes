Ten years ago, I joined the pharmaceutical and life-science industry to perform
applied research after I got my PhD degree. Working as a computational biologist
in drug discovery, I often get questions from students and junior researchers
who are in their first postdoc position. The most frequent question that I get
is &lsquo;*How does industrial research look like/compare with
academia?*&rsquo;. It is only closely followed by the relevant question:
&lsquo;*Would you recommend working in industry?*&rsquo;.

Both questions show that, despite huge investment in research and development by
the pharmaceutical and life-science industry (some companies spend almost 20% of
their income), industrial research remains mysterious for students and junior
researchers (and probably even more so for the public). It is therefore not
surprising that when students and junior researchers weight their career
options, they often leave out the option of pursuing a postdoc position in
industrial research, or rank it behind other options, for instance pursuing a
tenure track in academia, working for government or non-government
organizations, or applying for a permanent position in industry (perhaps in the
belief that such positions are more stable). The fact that there are much fewer
industrial postdoc positions, in contrast with the abundance of academic postdoc
positions (though individual experience may vary here), also contributes to the
limited awareness about them.

I believe that it is worth doing a postdoc in industrial research, both
professionally and personally. If you have the opportunity to work with a good
mentor, in a supportive team, and in a company that respects and values
research, it can be a rewarding step in your career.

I gained this belief by working together with and learning from postdocs both in
academia and in industry. They include my academic collaborators, postdocs in
the company that I have either worked with or supervised, and researchers who
transitioned from academic postdoc positions to industry.

These postdoc fellows shared both success stories and frustrations with me. They
confided me with their experience, feelings, and thoughts, many of which are
valuable for but barely accessible to other students and researchers. It is my
privilege to listen to and learn from so many enthusiastic, talented, and
hard-working scientists. While great resources are available helping people make
decisions between academia and industry, for instance the [*Ten Simple Rules for
Choosing between Industry and
Academia*](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000388) by David B. Searls
(*PLOS Computational Biology*, 5(6), 2009), a dedicated discussion about
industrial postdoc positions, particularly in the pharmaceutical and
life-science industry, has been missing in public forums. Therefore, I feel
obliged to synthesize my thoughts with many peoples' inputs on this topic and
put them down.

# Benefits of doing a postdoc in industry

There are many reasons speaking for doing a postdoc in industry. Below are the
ones that I found appealing to most people that I know.

Let us start with your long-term goal. Can you imagine putting your scientific
and personal knowledge and skills in an industrial setting, namely performing
applied research to turn discoveries and knowledge into product and profit?

This question has a ethical aspect. While some people believe that science is
useless unless it serves the benefit of the mankind, there are also people argue
that the scientific ideal of objectivity and truth-seeking is eroded by the
pursuit of profit.

If you have thought about the question and your answer is &lsquo;Yes&rsquo;,
doing a postdoc there is a good start. Compared with a permanent position, which
cannot be permanent in reality because of reorganizations, acquisitions, and
mergers, a postdoc position offers an opportunity to observe and try the working
conditions in industry without being bound to them for a long time. The
competition to get the position is high, due to the limited job offering and the
benefits that are discussed below, but the reward is correspondingly attractive.
During the postdoc, you will enjoy both rich resources provided by the company ,
including the latest technologies, invited talks, and visiting opportunities,
and connections and collaborations with other researchers in the world. If you
seize the chance to make discoveries that improve our understanding of human
diseases and how drugs work (or not), you will have many doors open to you after
the postdoc, including those positions that require &lsquo;industrial working
experience&rsquo;, for which fresh PhD students and academic postdocs are
(sometimes unreasonably) not eligible.

You may have long determined to apply your capacities in industry. Your decision
may base on various considerations: better benefits in general, more direct
impact of your work, more respect for work-life balance, less emphasis on grant
application and paper writing and first-authorship (you can be a respectable
scientist without being a first-author), *etc.* A postdoc position offers a
reality check: do the benefits match the working conditions? Is the expected
impact realistic and reachable? Does the work-life balance meet your
expectations? Are you satisfied with the fact that not all findings can be
shared with a wide community in a timely manner, at least not without legal and
intellectual-property considerations? The situation differs between companies
and between research areas, and one person's experience differs from that of
another one. Working as an industrial postdoc can either confirm your idea or
challenge it, enriching your experience in either way. It is like a honeymoon:
one is (hopefully) still under hormones, but at least some unrealistic
expectations will be smoothed out, while unexpected joys and frustrations may
bring new insights.

What happens if your answer to the question above is 'I do not know'? This is
okay. After all, like many other people, you may have no or little experience
with research in industry, unless that you have worked there or have
participated in academic-industrial collaborations. A postdoc position offers
you both an opportunity to get first-hand experience with industrial research
and time to reflect in order to take decisions. The only way to find the answer
to the question above is to give it a try yourself.

Even if your long-term goal is to build your expertise and career in academia,
an industrial postdoc experience may pay off in an unexpected manner. It can
help you grasp a comprehensive view of the practical side of your discipline and
its connections to other disciplines. In industrial research, the chance that
one discipline generating all research products, which later translate into
revenues and profits, dwindles to near zero. Take drug discovery as an example:
the list of disciplines that contribute to a new drug is long: biology,
chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, computer science, mathematics, statistics,
engineering, *etc.* As a postdoc in industry, you are certainly expected to dive
deep into your discipline. At the same time, you will be inevitably exposed to
other research areas that are at least as exciting and important as yours own.
Being informed about the existence, importance, and problem-solving approaches
of related fields, and about the unique contribution of your research, is an
important plus for a postdoc position in industry. It helps you identify
questions that really matter, and come up with solutions that are more likely to
be practical and impactful. The success of many academic scholars who have had
industrial working experience demonstrates that.

It is not to say that postdocs in academia are not informed about related
fields. In contrast, quite a few interesting academic postdoc projects that I
know are in fact the result of interdisciplinary collaboration. The major
difference between industry and academia lies in the incentives: while
industrial research puts investment return at the first place and therefore
values practical, applicable innovations that may turn into revenue and profit,
academic research is sometimes deemed as 'pure', driven primarily by curiosity
and novelty, and awarded mainly by publications, grants, and permanent
positions. A complex and valued product is usually the outcome of extensive
human collaboration - just think of the long closing credits following
blockbuster films - and can hardly be delivered by experts of one discipline.
In contrast, an immortal paper or a distinguished career as a professor can
thrive on deep work in one area. Industrial research is thus born more
collaborative and interdisciplinary.

Besides as a means to achieve your long-term goal, working as an industrial
postdoc also creates, shapes, and expands your personal network in a different
way than an academic career would do. The industrial network, thanks to the
interdisciplinary nature, may consist of more diverse people with regard to
their nationality, educational background, and life philosophy. It may provide
only limited help when it comes to publications or grant applications, but does
provide you alternative views of work and life, which can be refreshing or even
thought-provoking. The benefit of such a network is also long-lasting: while the
postdoc contract has an end date, the contact network persists when you leave
the company or even the field of science. Having an active and heterogeneous
network may open unexpected new doors in later stages of your life.

In short, joining industry as a postdoc brings both professional and personal
benefits.

# Considerations on doing a postdoc in industry

A postdoc position in industry demands more than excellence in your own field.
It requires that you communicate with experts of other fields and even influence
them. The primary goal is not confined to publishing papers (which are
nevertheless often desired) or to getting grants (probably rarely so). You are
expected to deliver convincing work that inspire others: scientists, managers,
and even investors. Are you a computational biologist? You do not stop when you
develop a new algorithm or model to explain things. You strive to make
predictions that wet-lab biologists and chemists can test. Are you a biologist?
Your goal extends beyond describing and explaining what you observe. You put
them into the disease context and suggest new therapies. And so on. In short,
your work is judged not only by novelty, but also by applicability: does it
work? Does it improve the way how we discover new drugs? Can we make better
decisions about what patients need next than we could have done without your
research?

In short, your duty as a industrial research postdoc is to communicate and
collaborate to bring a research idea into life, which shall create products and
value in the coming months or years. You take a professional attitude and put
personal interests behind a common goal. It can be quite a challenge, especially
for graduate students that are trained to work in a different way.

Again, this does imply that academic postdocs are narrowly or blindly focused on
their own fields of research. Quite on the opposite, I personally know
outstanding postdocs that outreach and collaborate beyond boundaries, who have
made a great impact both within and beyond their fields. I have little doubt
that many of them would do a great job in industry as well if they wish so and
if they are given the chance. In case you are new to interdisciplinary teamwork,
though, I wish to state the responsibility of an industrial postdoc explicitly
so that you are prepared.

Working in interdisciplinary teams may lead you to ask yourself: what is the
point of going so deep in my field? Some people may answer: well, not that much.
They may find other jobs in the company or in other companies later. Other
people will instead learn from the interactions exactly why their research is
important, and get motivated to dive deeper. Yet other people will spot the
needs and gaps on the interfaces between disciplines, develop new techniques and
skills, and even create new research areas - these people often become giants in
the field. Learning how to constantly learn and apply new things, how to solve
complex problems under practical constraints such as time and budget, and how to
being both an respectable scientist and a team player is utterly important for a
postdoc in industry. If you take the challenge seriously, you may constantly
review your work critically and ask yourself: does my research matter? How can I
make it matter even more? By asking these questions and searching for answers, I
guess we may become better people and better scientists.

Besides scientific work, there is a social aspect of doing a postdoc in
industry. In fields relevant for the pharmaceutical and life-science industry,
for instance chemistry and biology, far more researchers perform their postdoc
research in academia than in industry. This may make it difficult for industrial
postdocs to exchange experience and perspectives, both personal and scientific,
with other fellows. Luckily, though, there are more and more communities for
postdocs and other junior researchers inside and between companies nowadays, so
that an industrial postdoc does not mean working in isolation. Nevertheless,
more can be done to promote exchange between industrial and academic postdocs.
The exchange is not only beneficial for science, but also important for the
mental health and personal development of postdoc researchers.

During the postdoc, changes may happen to the project or to the team.
For instance, if the postdoc project was closely linked with a particular
product and the company lost its interest in the product, the postdoc faces the
danger of not able to proceed his project. Alternatively, if the organization
in which the supervisor and the postdoc are working in is restructured, the
continuation of the project may face practical challenges. It is wise to
consider these risks before the project starts and implement countermeasures,
for instance setting up a project that will eventually benefit several projects,
and defining a plan B in case of reorganization events.

Though in general industrial postdocs have bright outlooks, it is a
dangerous thought to think of a postdoc contract as a ticket to permanent
employment in the same company. Past experience suggests that while all postdocs
find jobs when they finish, only a small proportion stay. The postdoc is
probably best imagined as a room where you as a kid can are free to create,
experiment, and invite friends to play together. The room can be turned into a
gallery when you leave. Is is not a cradle in which you as an infant feel safe,
seek comfort, and fall asleep. The bitterness awaits when you wake up.

Since we are discussing the perspective: I have met students who worry that
their experience in industry may bring them unpleasant questions in future job
interviews, in case they return to academia later - &lsquo;Did you decide to
join industry? Why do you now come back?&rsquo;. I think there are two aspects
here. In many cases, people are just curious - after all, many interviewers are
also scientists like us, who are at least defined by their curiosity. Some
students worry that the questions are not free of a scrutinizing undertone. I do
not know how often this happens. I believe, however, that a capable scientist is
welcome anywhere, whether she or he has stayed in academia or has switched
between the sides.

In industry, you will likely communicate and collaborate. You will be challenged
by yourself and the environment a lot. Consider it well before you decide for a
postdoc there.

# Preparations once you have made up your mind

When there is a job vacancy and you consider applying for it, make sure that you
have a clearly defined research project and a respectable supervisor. An ideal
research project have three properties: it addresses the most important question
in your field (&lsquo;what are the important problems in your field, and why
aren't you working on them?&rsquo;, often asks the mathematician Richard
Hamming), you resonate with it and believe that you can contribute to solving it
with your unique expertise and experience, and it can be executed with the
dedicated resources. If case of any doubt and ambiguity about any of these
properties, make sure that you understand the last detail before you apply.

Your supervisor is ideally a competent scientist that is recognized both inside
the company and in the scientific community. Beyond that, the importance of a
caring supervisor who respects your ideas, gives you the freedom to execute the
project, and supports your development cannot be overestimated. Sometimes, an
industrial postdoc can have more than one supervisors, including academic
co-supervisors. Make sure that you talk with them and try to understand what
motivates them. To an extent, choosing the right people to work with is more
important than where those people work, let it be industry or academia.

The same process of talking with and learning from people can be done for the
team you will be in, especially those you will interact with. A mutual
fit will increase both the likelihood of success of your postdoc project and the
life satisfaction of you and team members.

Because the positions are limited and there are usually many outstanding
candidates with matching profiles, it can happen that your application is
rejected. Do not take this personal. Ask for feedback and suggestions if
possible.

Let us suppose that you have convinced the recruiting team, received an offer,
and you are determined to take the industrial postdoc job. How to prepare for
it? You can get a mental picture of the work ahead by talking with your future
supervisor(s) and team members and asking them questions. The questions can be
about the project. For instance, what is the expected outcome in terms of
publications, patents, *etc.*? Are there past experience and existing solutions
in your or another team that can help with some part of the project? Where do
they foresee the applications of the outcome? The questions can also be about
personal and career development: what training opportunities does the company
offer? Is there an ombudsman or ombudswoman whom you can turn to in case of
conflicts? What are the possibilities after the postdoc? Do not be shy to ask
questions. People were in your shoes not so long ago.

Be prepared to keep asking questions and upholding communications with your
colleagues after you enter the job. It helps to orient yourself and to
understand the team. You will soon have a fair idea how team members help each
other, how willing they are to help you - which can be very valuable - and how
you can help them in turn. Knowing the background, motivation, and unique skills
of team members and collaborators will make you get help faster when you need
it. The knowledge will also help you strengthen and expand your network by
spreading the word to others who may need help.

It is important to strike a balance between being focused and looking one step
ahead. On the one hand, you must focus on your postdoc project and deliver
within defined time and budget new insights and tools. On the other hand, it is
wise to cast a plan for the post-postdoc time, regularly review it, and adjust
it accordingly: Are you on the right track with regard to publications,
networking, *etc.*? What skills do you have to learn to make your next step
feasible? Admittedly, it is challenging to keep the balance well all the time.
It becomes easier with exercise. Self-reflections and exchange with the
supervisor or a caring team member make quite a difference, too. Do not worry if
you struggle to find the balance: we all have to learn it all life long.

Last but not least, joining industry does not mean cutting your relationship
with academia. It is helpful to stay in touch with your peers, mentors, and
collaborators both personally and professionally. If you wish and if your
current supervisor and colleagues like it, you can discuss your future plans
with them. They may share new insights with you based on their own experience.
You may even continue collaborating with them while being a postdoc in the
company, depending on the needs of the project and on policies of the company
and of the academic institute. As the Chinese put it, do not burn the bridge.
Build it instead.

Finding the right project and the right supervisor, asking questions, balancing
focus and perspective, and keeping academic relations, alas, do not guarantee a
perfect start in your industrial postdoc position. Nevertheless, they may
make the transition and start easier.

# How should I decide on whether or not working as an industrial postdoc?

You are welcome to use the list of considerations above to inform your decision.
Gather more information by talking with family members and friends about your
ambitions, questions, and worries. Listen to yourself. Make a decision. Go
ahead.

No matter what your choice is: be open, be kind, learn, and discover.

The postdoc is, after all, only one step in a long career. Even if it turns out
to be a detour, you may take something useful and memorable from it. Much luck
and success with your decision!
