## Drug discovery

### Feasibility and safety profiles of CRISPR-edited T cell therapy

[Lu *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0840-5) reported on
*Nature Medicine* the results of a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of
CRISPR-Cas9 PD-1-edited T cells with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

All primary and secondary endpoints were met. Of 22 patients enrolled, 12 (54%)
were able to receive treatment. The authors used sequencing to determine
mutation frequency at selected sites: The median mutation frequency of
off-target events was 0.05% (range, 0-0.25%) at 18 candidate sites.

## Biology

### APOE4 and blood-brain barrier

[Montagne *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2247-3) reported
in *Nature* that genetic variant APOE4 of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene
causes cognitive impairment by destabilising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They
also reported the soluble form of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) as a
biomarker of APOE4-associated BBB destabilisation, independent of Tau and
Amyloid-beta status.

The mechanism suggested by the authors is that APOE4 induces cyclophilin A
(CypA, Peptidylprolyl isomerase A, or the PPIA gene) and matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). They are components of the inflammatory pathways in
pericytes. Pericytes are multifunctional *mural* cells that wrap around
endothelial cells that line the capillaries and venules. Paracrine signalling of
CypA and MMP9 in other pericytes and perhaps endothelial cells leads to
destabilization of BBB.

The freely available [*News and Views*
article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01152-8) by Ishii and
Iadecola summarized the findings.

### Migroglia and border-associated macrophages

[Utz *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30283-X)
explained on *Cell* their work to dissect two types of macrophages in the
central nervous system: microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs). They
are different in phenotype, transcriptional expression profile, and
localization. Both are present in the yolk sac. Whereas the development of
microglia depends on TGF-beta, BAMs develop independent of it.

### Doubling the half-life of *ex vivo* expanded Tregs with IL-2

[Furlan *et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189290/)
reported on *Blodd Advances* that adding Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the presence of
rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug, increases the half-life of of the
regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune
system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune diseases.
Single-cell sequencing showed that early after addition of IL-2, cells showed
gene expression profiles similar to those of activated Tregs.  Interestingly,
the most activated ones seem also to show signs of p53-mediated apoptosis.
After 20 days of *in vitro* culture, however, the expression profiles resemble
rather those of resting Tregs.

### A human skeletal muscle atlas

[Xi *et
al.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1934590920301569)
reported on *Cell Stem Cell* a collection of human skeletal muscle cell
expression profiles measured by single-cell RNA sequencing. The profiled muscle
cells include embryonic, fetal, and postnatal stages, as well as cell cultures
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). An important finding is that
pluripotent stem-cell derived muscle cells produced by all the methods they
tried resembled muscle progenitor cells at an early stage, and did not align to
adult muscle stem cells.

### Cell-specific drug effects in pancreatic islets

[Marquina-Sanchez *et
al*](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02006-2)
reported on *Genome Biology* an interesting finding using single-cell RNA
sequencing with spike-in reference cells as controls.

They observed contamination by cell-free RNA, which can constitute up to 20% in
human primary tissue samples. By assuming linear mixing model, the authors could
decontaminate the data. Using this and other analysis methods, they investigated
the effect of FOXO1, a transcription factor of the Forkhead family, and
compounds that inhibits FOXO in human and mouse pancreatic islets.

The computational pipeline is available at
[Github](https://github.com/epigen/Artemether_scRNA). 10X and Drop-seq
sequencing data are available in NCBI GEO, under accession number
[GSE147203](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147203) and
[GSE147202](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE147203),
respectively.

## Computer science

### Probabilistic programming and Bayesian methods for programmers

I discovered this [Github project of
CamDavidsonPilon](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
sometime ago. It introduces Bayesian Methods to programmers and hackers.

### Review on deep learning and graph networks

I read the review by [Battaglia *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261) on
*Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks* (2018), which
was discovered from
[集智俱乐部](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Mt9xkaD2P3DlfeDZEzL3VA) on WeChat. 

The learning notes were posted in the blog post [Deep learning with graph
networks]({% post_url 2020-05-12-graph-networks %}).

### Interview with Donald Knuth

The Quanta Magazine published an interview with Donald Knuth under the title
[*The computer scientist who can't stop telling
stories*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/).
The sentences most impressed me included:

* "The best way to communicate from one human being to another is through
   story."
* "The ultimate test of whether I understand something is if I can
   explain it a computer. ... In most of life, you can bluff, but not with
   computers."
* "A person's success in life is determined by having a high
   minimum, not a high maximum. ... if almost everything you do is up there, then
   you've got a good life. And so I try to learn how to get through things that
   others find unpleasant."

What is the difference between a story and a computer program? With a story you
appeal to emotions, including curiosity, fantasy, and satisfaction of hearing a
good story. With a program you instruct, give facts, and design logic. At the
same time, both share verbal communication. It is the key to both effective
collaboration and powerful instructions. In my opinion, this is one of the most
important soft skills that I should improve and sharpen as a computational
biologist working in drug discovery.

### Tricks that I learned

* Clean unused packages in conda with `conda clean --all`.
* Update dependent packages using pip with `pip install PACKAGE --upgrade
    --upgrade-strategy [eager|only-if-needed]`.

## HBVouroboros

This week I published an open-source bioinformatics tool, named *HBVouroboros*,
on GitHub [BEDApub/HBVouroboros](https://github.com/bedapub/HBVouroboros).

The ouroboros (or uroboros) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon
eating its own tail. In its twisted form, an ouroboros reassembles covalently
closed circular DNA (cccDNA) of hepatitis B virus (HBV).

HBVouroboros implements a snakemake-based workflow to map Illumina
RNA-sequencing reads to HBV cccDNA. HBVouroboros offers following
functionalities:

* Mapping reads to reference genomes of of eight major HBV genotypes (A-H). The
  mapping procedure takes care of reads that span the junctions between the two
  ends of the linear form of the cccDNA. This holds true also for mapping
  procedures described later.
* De novo assembly of the HBV genome.
* Inference of the reference strain from which the reads are likely generated
  and genotype calling using BLAST and data from *HBVdb*.
* Base-level, gene-level, and HBV-genome-level quantification of
  read counts, as well as structural variants with regard to the inferred
  reference strain.

Check it out and let me know if you have suggestions how to improve it:

## Other gems

* [hackl/tikz-network](https://github.com/hackl/tikz-network) visualizes complex
    networks in Latex, for instance multilayer networks.
* [bness/GGN](https://github.com/bnusss/GGN) is a software that learns from
  dynamics in order to infer and reconstruct the network structure.
* [goldendict](http://goldendict.org/) is a feature-rich desktop dictionary
   programm. The code is stable (the last update is 2011). I used it on my Linux
   machine this week. Several functionalities are important for me: supporting
   both local dictionaries and online ones including Wiktionary and Google
   Translation, Hunspelling-supported spell check, and cross-platform support.
* [A trick to delete files with special character in their names in
    Linux](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-shell-tip-remove-files-names-contains-spaces-and-special-characters-such/):
    use `ls -li`to display the index number (`inode`) of the files. Suppose the
    file you wish to delete has a inode number of 1234, which is shown in the
    first column of the output of `ls -li`, then use `find . -inum 1234 -delete`
    to delete it. The link above also introduces other methods.
* [*MuseScore*](https://musescore.org/en) is an open-source software for music
  notation.  I started using it to arrange some of my exercise piano pieces.
  This week I followed the compact and informative tutorial series of the
  software made by Dr. George Hess on
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTYuWi2LmaPGb4SKXHm9JULQ-0CH8KpUk).
  It was well made and introduces someone totally new to the software like me
  the basics to start inputting and laying out notes quickly.
