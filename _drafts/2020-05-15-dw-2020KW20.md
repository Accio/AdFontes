## Drug discovery

### Feasibility and safety profiles of a CRISPR-edited T cells in small-cell lung cancer

[Lu *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0840-5) reported on *Nature Medicine* the results of a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of CRISPR-Cas9 PD-1-edited T cells with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

All primary and secondary endpoints were met. Of 22 patients enrolled, 12 (54%) were able to receive treatment. The median mutation frequency of off-target events was 0.05% (range, 0-0.25%) at 18 candidate sites. 

## Biology

### APOE4 and blood-brain barrier

[Montagne *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2247-3) reported in *Nature* that genetic variant APOE4 of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene causes cognitive impairment by destabilising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They also reported the soluble form of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) as a biomaker of APOE4-associated BBB destabilisation, indepedent of Tau and Amyloid-beta status.

The mechanism suggested by the authors is that APOE4 induces cyclophilin A (CypA, Peptidylprolyl isomerase A, or the PPIA gene) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). They are components of the inflammatory pathways in pericytes. Paracrine signalling of CypA and MMP9 in other pericytes and perhaps endothelial cells leads to destablization of BBB.

The freely available [*News and Views* article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01152-8) by Ishii and Iadecola summarized the findings. 

### Migroglia and border-associated macrophages

[Utz *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30283-X) explained on *Cell* their work to dissect two types of macrophages in the central nervous system: microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs). They are different in phenotype, transcriptional expression profile, and localization. Both are present in the yolk sac. Whereas the development of microglia depends on TGF-beta, BAMs develop independent of it. 

## Computer science

### Probabilistic programming and Bayesian methods for programmers

I discovered this [Github project of CamDavidsonPilon](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) sometime ago. It introduces Bayesian Methods to programmers and hackers.

### Interview with Donald Knuth

The Quanta Magazine published an interview with Donald Knuth under the title [*The computer scientist who can't stop telling stories*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/). The sentences most impressed me included:

* "The best way to communicate from one human being to another is through story."
* "The ultimate test of whether I understand something is if I can explain it a computer. ... In most of life, you can bluff, but not with computers."
* "A person's success in life is determined by having a high minimum, not a hige maximum. ... if almost everything you do is up there, then you've got a good life. And so I try to learn how to get through things that others find unpleasant."

What is the difference between a story and a programme? With a story you appeal to emotions, including curiosity, fantasy, and satisfaction of hearing a good story. With a programm you instruct, give facts, and design logic. At the same time, both share verbal communication. It is the key to both effective collaboration and powerful instructions. In my opinion, this is one of the most important soft skills that I should improve and sharpen as a computational biologist working in drug discovery.
