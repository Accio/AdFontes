## Drug discovery

### Feasibility and safety profiles of CRISPR-edited T cell therapy

[Lu *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0840-5) reported on
*Nature Medicine* the results of a first-in-human phase I clinical trial of
CRISPR-Cas9 PD-1-edited T cells with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.

All primary and secondary endpoints were met. Of 22 patients enrolled, 12 (54%)
were able to receive treatment. The authors used sequencing to determine
mutation frequency at selected sites: The median mutation frequency of
off-target events was 0.05% (range, 0-0.25%) at 18 candidate sites.

## Biology

### APOE4 and blood-brain barrier

[Montagne *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2247-3) reported
in *Nature* that genetic variant APOE4 of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene
causes cognitive impairment by destabilising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). They
also reported the soluble form of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB) as a
biomarker of APOE4-associated BBB destabilisation, independent of Tau and
Amyloid-beta status.

The mechanism suggested by the authors is that APOE4 induces cyclophilin A
(CypA, Peptidylprolyl isomerase A, or the PPIA gene) and matrix
metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9). They are components of the inflammatory pathways in
pericytes. Pericytes are multifunctional *mural* cells that wrap around
endothelial cells that line the capillaries and venules. Paracrine signalling of
CypA and MMP9 in other pericytes and perhaps endothelial cells leads to
destabilization of BBB.

The freely available [*News and Views*
article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01152-8) by Ishii and
Iadecola summarized the findings.

### Migroglia and border-associated macrophages

[Utz *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30283-X)
explained on *Cell* their work to dissect two types of macrophages in the
central nervous system: microglia and border-associated macrophages (BAMs). They
are different in phenotype, transcriptional expression profile, and
localization. Both are present in the yolk sac. Whereas the development of
microglia depends on TGF-beta, BAMs develop independent of it.

### Doubling the half-life of *ex vivo* expanded Tregs with IL-2

[Furlan *et al.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189290/)
reported on *Blodd Advances* that adding Interleukin-2 (IL-2) in the presence of
rapamycin, an immunosuppressant drug, increases the half-life of of the
regulatory T cells (Tregs), a subpopulation of T cells that modulate the immune
system, maintain tolerance to self-antigens, and prevent autoimmune diseases.
Single-cell sequencing showed that early after addition of IL-2, cells showed
gene expression profiles similar to those of activated Tregs.  Interestingly,
the most activated ones seem also to show signs of p53-mediated apoptosis.
After 20 days of *in vitro* culture, however, the expression profiles resemble
rather those of resting Tregs.

## Computer science

### Probabilistic programming and Bayesian methods for programmers

I discovered this [Github project of
CamDavidsonPilon](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers)
sometime ago. It introduces Bayesian Methods to programmers and hackers.

### Review on deep learning and graph networks

I am reading review by [Battaglia *et al.*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261)
on *Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks* (2018),
which was discovered from
[集智俱乐部](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Mt9xkaD2P3DlfeDZEzL3VA) on WeChat.

### Interview with Donald Knuth

The Quanta Magazine published an interview with Donald Knuth under the title
[*The computer scientist who can't stop telling
stories*](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/).
The sentences most impressed me included:

* "The best way to communicate from one human being to another is through
   story."
* "The ultimate test of whether I understand something is if I can
   explain it a computer. ... In most of life, you can bluff, but not with
   computers."
* "A person's success in life is determined by having a high
   minimum, not a high maximum. ... if almost everything you do is up there, then
   you've got a good life. And so I try to learn how to get through things that
   others find unpleasant."

What is the difference between a story and a computer program? With a story you
appeal to emotions, including curiosity, fantasy, and satisfaction of hearing a
good story. With a program you instruct, give facts, and design logic. At the
same time, both share verbal communication. It is the key to both effective
collaboration and powerful instructions. In my opinion, this is one of the most
important soft skills that I should improve and sharpen as a computational
biologist working in drug discovery.

## Other gems

* [hackl/tikz-network](https://github.com/hackl/tikz-network) visualizes complex
    networks in Latex, for instance multilayer networks.
* [bness/GGN](https://github.com/bnusss/GGN) is a software that learns from
  dynamics in order to infer and reconstruct the network structure.
* [goldendict](http://goldendict.org/) is a feature-rich desktop dictionary
   programm. The code is stable (the last update is 2011). I used it on my Linux
   machine this week. Several functionalities are important for me:
   supporting both local dictionaries and online ones including Wiktionary and
   Google Translation, Hunspelling-supported spell check, and cross-platform
   support.
