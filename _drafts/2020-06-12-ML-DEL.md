category: DrugDiscovery

The post [Unlocking the "Chemome" with DNA-Encoded Chemistry and Machine
Learning] in the [*Google AI
Blog*](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/06/unlocking-chemome-with-dna-encoded.html?m=1)
features a paper by [McCloskey *et
al*](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c00452) on *Journal of
Medicinal Chemistry* (2020), reporting an application of machine learning to
DNA-Encoded Library (DEL) screening results. Here are my learning notes.

## DNA-encoded small molecule libraries


## Conclusions

Derek Lowe also shared his impressions and insights on the paper from the
perspective of a medicinal chemist in a [post](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/16/machine-learning-on-top-of-dna-encoded-libraries) in his blog *In the pipeline*, which I recommend reading.
