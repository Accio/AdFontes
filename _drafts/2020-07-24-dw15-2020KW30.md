## Biology

### Dynamics in protein translation sustaining T cell preparedness

Wolf ang Jin *et al.* reported on [Nature
Immunology](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-020-0714-5) their study of
dynamics of mRNA translation kinetics and protein turnover in human naive and
activated T cells. They found that transcription factors (TFs) maintaining T
cell quiescence had constitutively high turnover, which facilitated their
depletion following activation. Naive T cells maintain a large number of idling
ribosomes, repressed mRNAs, and glycolytic enzymes that can be rapidly engaged
upon stimulation, promoting an immediate translational and glycolytic switch to
ramp up the T cell activation.

They provide a resource of protein turnover, absolute translation kinetics, and
protein synthesis rates in T cells at

## Programming

### Continuous documentation, testing, and integration of R packages

See [my other blogpost]({% post_url 2020-07-22-updating-ribiosUtils %}) for my
learning notes, with the updating of the
[ribiosUtils](bedapub.github.io/ribiosUtils) package as an example.
