## Use pkgdown, rhub, and GitHub Action for ribiosUtils

I used pkgdown, rhub, and GitHub Action to allow continuous integration and
delivery (CI/CD) for ribiosUtils.

* [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html) builds a website form the
    package using Rd files (which can come from, for instance, roxygen
    documentations).
  * I found that it had problems with functions whose examples
    write to the standard output. By wrapping such examples inside `\dontrun{}`,
* [The R-hub builder](https://builder.r-hub.io/) is a website which can be used
  to build a source R package into binaries on many different platforms
  including Mac, Linux, and Windows. Its R client,
  [`rhub`](https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/), can used to check R code on platforms
  other than the one the developer is working on.
* [r-lib/actions](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) list commonly used GitHub
    Actions for the R language. I used to copy and paste action definition files
    from there to my package. Lately, thanks to [this
    tutorial](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/actions_sandbox/) on GitHub Actions
    with R from Brown *et al.* (ropenscilabs), I found that the
    [usethis](https://github.com/r-lib/actions) package can be used to automate
    this process.
