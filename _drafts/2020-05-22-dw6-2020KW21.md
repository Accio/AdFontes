## Drug discovery

## Biology

### TASL identified as an adaptor in TLR7-9 signalling

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in recognizing pathogens and
initiating immune responses. [Heinz *et al.*, Nature
(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2282-0) showed that CXorf21,
a previously uncharacterised protein, interacts with the endolysosomal
transporter SLC15A4.

Both CXorf21 and SLC15A4 have been linked with autoimmune diseases before by
genetic studies. In this study, the authors found that loss of the CXorf21
protein, which the authors named 'TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the
lysosome' (TASL), abrogated responses to endolysosomal TLR agonists in human
immune cells. Deletion of either SLC15A4 or TASL impaired the activation of the
interferon response pathway, mediated by IRF5, without affecting either NF-kB or
MAPK signalling.

TASL works as an adaptor, interacting with SLC15A4 and activating IRF5, by a
conserved pLxIS motif, in which *p* denotes a hydrophilic residue and *x*
denotes any residue. Its role in TLR7/8/9 signalling is comparable to IRF3
adaptors, including [STING1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340061)
(stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1),
[MAVS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57506) (mitochondrial antiviral
signalling protein), and [TICAM1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/148022)
(toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1, also known as TRIF).

### Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Collaborating with Boehringer Ingelheim, Nature published a special [*Nature
Outlook*](https://www.nature.com/collections/ihiibiedga) about chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It contains several articles introducing
the disease and relevant research.

Interestingly, almost at the same time, [Rao *et
al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30340-8#%20) reported in
*Cell* that regenerative metaplastic clones in COPD lung drive inflammation and
fibrosis. *Metaplastic* means that cells show abnormal change in its nature. The
authors cloned individual cells from lung tissue of patients with and without
COPD. In normal lungs, normal distal airway progenitor are most prevalent. In
contrast, in COPD lungs, three variant progenitors are found, which are
epigenetically committed to distinct metaplastic lesions.

When transplanted in immunodeficient mice, these variant clones induced
pathology including metaplasia, neutrophilic inflammation, and fibrosis seen in
COPD. Surprisingly, these variants actually exist in control and fetal lung as
minor constituents, and they may act in normal processes of immune surveillance,
a natural physiological function to allow recognition and destruction of
transformed cells before they grow into tumours, and to kill tumours after they
are formed.

### CRIPSR as an broad-spectrum antiviral

[Abbott *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30483-9#%20)
from the Stanford University reported on *Cell* their application of the
CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short panlindromic repeats) technique as
a antiviral therapeutics.

Instead of commonly known Cas9, which cleaves DNA, they used
Cas13, which contains at least four known subtypes. Zhang
lab originally showed that [Cas13 cleaves RNA, protecting bacteria from RNA
phages and serving as a platform for RNA manipulation](https://zlab.bio/cas13).

Abbott *et al*. identified conserved regions between viral genomes, for instance
pan-corona virus targets, and designed CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that target such
conserved RNAs. They used such crRNAs as a prototype of a prophylactic antiviral
therapy named as PAC-MAN (prophylactic antiviral CRISPR in human cells).

They used all coronovavirus genomes that are available and performed
bioinformatics analysis to identify conserved regions. They identified 22
nucleotide crRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 genomes with perfect match that has one or no
mismatch to SARS or MERS. Based on mismatch analysis to human transcriptome
(fewer than 2 mistmatches), crRNA expression analysis, and removal of sequences
containing UUUU (poly-T sequences), they identified about 3.2k crRNA candidates.
They tested only 40 crRNAs, covering both RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp)
and N genes. They used reporter assays to show some of the crRNA candidate
worked.

Since they did not have access to live SARS-CoV-2 virus, they tested their
approach using an H1N1 strain of influenza A virus, using more or less the same
bioinformatics and lab approaches described for CoV-2. They show that at higher
concentrations (MOI), some crRNA could indeed specifically down-regulate IAV
genome segments. However, as the authors pointed out, no evidence was provided
about the *in vivo* efficacy.

Last but not least, they used bioinformatics analysis to show that 6 crRNAs are
able to target 90% of known CoV genomes. It suggests that the approach may be
used even for genomes with high mutation frequencies and genomic diversities.

It remains to be seen whether this approach would yield benefit *in vivo*. And
the toxicity in human cells, as far as I can see, remains to be rigorously
assessed. The delivery of the system is also a big challenge. On the other side,
I am happy to see that bioinformatics approach can assist high-throughput and
fast candidate selection of sequence-based vaccination and antiviral therapies.

### Other interesting staff

* [Simultaneous Readout of Lineage Histories and Gene Expression Profiles in
    Single Cells with CRIPSR array repair lineage tracing
    (CARLIN)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420305547?via%3Dihub)
    by Bowling *et al.* on *Cell*. The technique allows *in vivo* tracking of
    individual cells. I could imagine that such techniques can be used to
    understand time-dependent response to drug responses both *in vitro* and *in
    vivo*.
* [Kitchen *et
  al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30330-5#%20) reported
  on *Cell* that Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) mediates flux of water into astrocytes in
  hypoxia conditions, causing central nervous systems edema. Its translocation
  to cell surface is mediated by calmodulin (CaM, human genes CALM1, CALM2, and
  CALM3) and protein kinase A (PKA).  Inhibition of AQP4 localization by
  [trifluoperazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trifluoperazine), a typical
  antipsychotic to treat schizophrenia, ablated CNS edema. The author argues
  that is because trifluoperazine modulates calmodulin despite that it is also
  believed to block dopamine receptors D1 and D2.
* [Kim *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30406-2)
    reported on *Cell* a highly complex architecture of SARS-CoV-2
    transcriptome. Using [DNA nanoball
    sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_nanoball_sequencing), which
    uses rolling circle replication to amplify small fragments of genomic DNA
    into DNA nanoballs, and Nanopore direct RNA sequencing, they identified many
    discontinuous transcription events, unknown ORFs due to fusion, deletion,
    and frameshift, and modification sites on viral transcripts. Whether any
    functions are associated with these events, though, is not clear yet.

## Computer sciences

### Tricks that I learned

* How to install gcc-10 in Linux MINT 19.3? Run `sudo add-apt-repository
 ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test`, and then `sudo apt-cache search gcc-10`, you
 should see gcc-10 packages. Note that `add-apt-repository` may fail when a secure
 connection to the server is not possible, when instance when the machine is
 sitting behind a firewall.
* I learned to use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to send a Twitter message when my blog is updated, inspired by an article on the website [ictsolved](https://ictsolved.github.io/auto-post-articles-from-jekyll-blog-to-social-sites/).

## Computational biology

### Predicting cell lineages using autoencoders and optimal transport

[Yang *et
al.*](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007828)
reported their analysis strategy of single-cell imaging data on *PLOS
Computational Biology* (2020). The corresponding author is Caroline Uhler, with
whom I had very pleasant interactions during the Graphical Models Summer School
two years ago in Basel, co-organized by Niko Beerenwinkel, her, and other
colleagues. She has recently also joined D-BSSE (Department of Biosystems
Science and Engineering) of ETH ZÃ¼rich located at Basel.

### De novo protein design for RSV

[Sesterhenn *et
al*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6492/eaay5051/tab-pdf) reported
on *Nature* their effort to design proteins that neutralize RSV.

### Other interesting staff

* [Haddad, Adam, and
    Heger](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007449)
    offered ten quick tips for homology modelling of high-resolution 3D
    structures.
* [Cobey](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6492/713) discusses in a
    Perspective paper on *Nature* strengths and pitfalls of modelling infectious
    disease dynamics.

## Other gems

* I discovered [learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/) thanks to a
    Hacker News threshold. I am using it to learn [restructured text
    (RST)](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rst/), to refresh my knowledge in
    [Python](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/), and to learn using
    [docker](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/docker/).
* In an
    [interview](https://cacm.acm.org/news/244846-can-ai-become-conscious/fulltext)
    with Bennie Mols, neuroscientist Christof Koch talked about the [Integrated
    Information Theory
    (Wikilink)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory). He
    distinguished between intelligence and consciousness. According to him,
    intelligence is about behaviour, for instance what to do in a new
    environment. Consciousness is about being. And he argues that consciousness
    can not be deduced from behaviour. Rather, we have to check whether the
    system has *causal power*.
