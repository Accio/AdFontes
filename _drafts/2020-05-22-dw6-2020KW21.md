### TASL identified as an adaptor in TLR7-9 signalling

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in recognizing pathogens and
initiating immune responses. [Heinz *et al.*, Nature
(2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2282-0) showed that CXorf21,
a previously uncharacterised protein, interacts with the endolysosomal
transporter SLC15A4.

Both CXorf21 and SLC15A4 have been linked with autoimmune diseases before by
genetic studies. In this study, the authors found that loss of the CXorf21
protein, which the authors named 'TLR adaptor interacting with SLC15A4 on the
lysosome' (TASL), abrogated responses to endolysosomal TLR agonists in human
immune cells. Deletion of either SLC15A4 or TASL impaired the activation of the
interferon response pathway, mediated by IRF5, without affecting either NF-kB or
MAPK signalling.

TASL works as an adaptor, interacting with SLC15A4 and activating IRF5, by a
conserved pLxIS motif, in which *p* denotes a hydrophilic residue and *x*
denotes any residue. Its role in TLR7/8/9 signalling is comparable to IRF3
adaptors, including [STING1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/340061)
(stimulator of interferon response cGAMP interactor 1),
[MAVS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/57506) (mitochondrial antiviral
signalling protein), and [TICAM1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/148022)
(toll-like receptor adaptor molecule 1, also known as TRIF).
