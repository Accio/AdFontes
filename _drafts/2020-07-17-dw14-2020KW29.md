Here are some discoveries that fascinate me this week.

## Computational biology

### HLA and VDJ

Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode proteins that present antigens. VDJ
genes encode the receptors, which include T cell receptors (TCRs) in T cells and
the repertoires of antibodies (immunoglobulins) in B cells.

The GitHub repository
[slowkow/awesome-vdj](https://github.com/slowkow/awesome-vdj) collects tools and
datasets for antigen presentation and recognition.

### Embedding of transcription factors and binding sequences with BindSpace

[Yuan *et al.*, Nature Methods,
2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0511-y) reported their effort
to embed transcription factors and binding sequences in the same space, known as
`BindSpace`. The prediction model they built was trained by binding data of TFs
and embedding over one million sequences. The authors claimed that the model
achieved state-of-the-art multi-class binding prediction performance, and can
distinguish signals of closely related TFs.

### Other gems

* [Liu *et al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30755-8)
    reviewed 419 human virus transcriptional regulators that control expression
    of virus of 20 families.

## Programming

### tidylog

[elbersb/tidylog](https://github.com/elbersb/tidylog) provides logging for tidy
functions.

```R
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("tidylog", warn.conflicts = FALSE)

filtered <- filter(mtcars, cyl == 4)
#> filter: removed 21 rows (66%), 11 rows remaining
mutated <- mutate(mtcars, new_var = wt ** 2)
#> mutate: new variable 'new_var' (double) with 29 unique values and 0% NA
```

* [ggreer/the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) is
a code searcher similar to [`ack`](https://beyondgrep.com/), a grep-like source
code search tool.
* [seqeralabs/nextflow-tutorial](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nextflow-tutorial)
is a tutorial of NextFlow.
*  Workflow
systems play an ever more important role in computational biology.
[dib-lab/2020-workflows-paper](https://github.com/dib-lab/2020-workflows-paper)
is a repository underlying the bioarxiv preprint [Streamlining data-intensive
biology with workflow
systems](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.30.178673v1). A related
publication is [Open collaborative writing with
ManuBot](https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/).

## A Mobile Robotic Chemist

[The Robo Chemist](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2442-2), reported
by Burger *et al.* on Nature, demonstrates what can be achieved by automation
and robotics. See below a video.

What strikes me most is when Andrew Cooper, the principal investigator, said
they had no experience with robotics three years ago when they started the
project, and now they stand there with a very interesting product that may help
chemists screen molecules. For sure the team is a very good one, but it also
implies that the threshold of setting up robust robotic systems is becoming
lower and lower. I believe this will create a self-feedback system where such
robots will be quicker and better designed and engineered and applied. It
remains the BIG questions: do applications of such robots translate into better
research products (including drugs)? And what can we do with the time spared by
the robots?

Happy weekend!
