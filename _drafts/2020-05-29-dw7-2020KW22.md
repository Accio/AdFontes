### Human macrophage development at single-cell resolution

[Bian *et
al*.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2316-7) report on *Nature*
their effort to characterize human macrophage development at single-cell
resolution.

Macrophages are part of the innate immune system. They are also the first cells of
the nascent immune system that emerge during embryonic development. In mice,
embryonic macrophages infiltrate developing organs, and differentiate there into
tissue-resident macrophages. While this process is well characterized, how
macrophages in human differentiate during the development process is less well
known.

The authors determine to better understand this process from the perspective of
gene expression profiles of each macrophage cell. To this purpose, they isolated
CD45+ haematopoietic cells, the cells that responsible for the formation of
blood cellular components (`haema`=blood in Greek, `poiesis`=to make), from human
embryos. Next, they used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize them. In
particular, they performed single-cell culture of a subset of cells, known as
yolk sac-derived myeloid-biased progenitors that express surface markers CD45,
CD34, and CD44.

Such myeloid progenitors develop later into myeloid cells, including
megakaryocytes, erythrocytes, mast cells, and myeloblast including into
basophil, neutrophil, eosinophils, and monocytes, which mature into macrophages.
The alternative route to myeloid cell differentiation is to differentiate into
lymphoids, such as natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells. Together they
constitute the innate and adaptive immune system. The following figure by A. Rad
and Mikael Häggström, M.D., used under the GNU Free Documentation License,
provides a high-level overview of this process.

They investigated macrophage heterogeneity across multiple anatomical sites, and
identified different types of tissue residential macrophages in the central
nervous system, liver, lung, and skin. Further more, they analysed the
specification trajectories of resident macrophages, and compared embryonic
resident macrophages and their adult counterparts (the data of which were
collected from published studies).

The dataset can be interesting for macrophage researchers, and in particular
researchers of tissue resident macrophages such as microglia, a special type of
macrophages in the brain. And it can be a good reference dataset to benchmark
macrophages derived from induced pluripotent stem-cells.

The single-cell sequencing data of human yolk sacs are available on NCBI Gene
Expression Omnibus with the accession number
[GSE137010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE137010). The
data of haematopoietic cells in human embryos at different development stages
(known as Carnegie stages) and multiple sites (yolk sac, head, liver, blood,
lung, and skin) are available at
[GSE133345](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE133345).

* I discovered [Pure bash bible](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pure-bash-bible)
    by Dylan Araps on Github. It seems to be an interesting collection of tips
    and tricks of using bash to perform routine tasks.
