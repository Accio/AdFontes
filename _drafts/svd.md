A recent HackerNews news post on [Facebook and Cambridge Analytica](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/this-is-how-cambridge-analyticas-facebook-targeting-model-really-worked-according-to-the-person-who-built-it/) sheds quite some technical light on the matter. The author, Matthew Hindman, explained how the Facebook data was used to cluster users and predict their psychological profiles. An interesting read for people that are interested in machine learning and in particular how collaborative filtering can be applied in political campaigns.

In its essence, **s**ingular **v**value **d**ecomposition, known as *SVD*, was used. It is a dimention reduction algorithm that decomposes any matrix $$ M $$ into the product of three matrices $$ U\SigmaV $$.


 led me to Simon Funk and his contribution to the competition community that worked on the Netflix million-dolar price. And thanks to his and other people's work I deepened my understanding of singular value decomposition (SVD) and its application in collaborative filtering.
