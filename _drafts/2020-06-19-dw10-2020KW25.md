## Biology

### Physiology, pathology, and therapeutical applications of TREM2

[Deczkowska *et
al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30565-1) explores the
TREM2 receptor pathway as a major pathology-induced immune signalling mediator.

### Single-cell and secretome atlas of human enteroendocrine cells

[Beumer *et al*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30501-8)
reports transcriptomics profiling and secretome analysis of human
enteroendocrine cells in a human organoid biobank.

### DNA of neutrophil extracellular traps promotes cancer metastasis via CCDC25

Neutrophils are cells in the blood that are promptly (within minutes) and
strongly activated upon infection by microorganisms. They have a very special
trick to clear microorganisms: they can secret neutrophil extracellular traps,
which consist of chromatin DNA filaments that are coated with proteins that are
usually stored in granules in the cells. These traps made of DNA and proteins
coat and lock the microorganisms so that the whole thing can be cleared by
phagocytotic cells like macrophages.

The traps, alas, seem not only provide advantage to the host, though. [Yang *et
al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2394-6) reported on *Nature*
that they found abundant such traps in the metastases, and the traps in the
serum can predict the occurrence of metastases. They report that DNA in the
traps, known as neutrophil-extracellular-trap (NET) DNA, attract cancer cells
rather than acting only as a &lsquo;trap&rsquo;. They found that the protein
[CCDC25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2394-6) (coiled-coil domain
containing 25, GeneID 55246) acts as a NET-DNA sensor, which can act the
ILK-beta-parvin pathway to enhance cell motility.

They showed that NET-mediated metastasis can be abrogated in CCDC25-knockout
cells. The results suggest that targeting CCDC25 may be a therapeutic strategy
for the prevention of cancer metastasis.

and Ilaria Malanchi summarizes the findings.

## Programming

### Submitting Snakemake jobs to SLURM

I was often confused by the SLURM settings for Snakemake. One reason is that we
can specify resource requirements at different places:

1. Per rule level: `threads`.
1. Per workflow level: `cluster.json`, which can be read by Snakemake API in the
   `cluster` option:
    * `nodes`, in the form of `min-max`, specifies the minimum number and
	maximum number of nodes used *per job*.
    * `-n`, or `--ntasks`, advices how many tasks will be performed on each
	node. By default it is 1.
    * `-c`, or `--cpus-per-task`, advices how many CPUs each task needs, again
	*per job*. It is only an advise to tell slurm how to smartly allocate
	nodes. It does not limit the number of CPUs in use.
1. In case we use the [Snakemake API](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference/snakemake.html), we can specify following parameters per workflow level: `cores`, `nodes`, `local_cores`, `resources`, and `default_resources`. In contrast to the settings passed `cluster`, they affect the workflow.

* [multicore support of slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/mc_support.html)
* [cluster execution of
    Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/v5.1.4/executable.html#cluster-execution)

    API](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference/snakemake.html)

### Other programming tricks that I learned

* Often we have a list of strings in a tab-delimited file, like
    `S1,S2,S3,...,S10,...`, which we would like to sort by the numeric part of
    the string. The solution is to use `sort -V`. `-V` or `--version-sort`
    performs natural sort of (version) numbers within text. Source:
    [nitin@StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16945134/bash-sort-list-of-strings-by-number-at-the-end).
* `gensub` in `awk` can perform pattern matching and back reference. Below is an
    example. Source: [GNU manual of
    gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html).

```bash
echo "S10_10" | awk '{
  a=gensub(/S(.+)_(.+)/, "\\1", "g");
  b=gensub(/S(.+)_(.+)/, "\\2", "g");
  print a,b;}'
## output: 10 10
```

### How to overcome a fear of heights

The Psyche magazine of Aeon, a online magazine of philosophy and culture,
published an interesting article on [how to overcome a fear of
heights](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-overcome-a-fear-of-heights-step-by-careful-step)
by Poppy Brown.
