## Biology

### Physiology, pathology, and therapeutical applications of TREM2

[Deczkowska *et
al.*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30565-1) explores the
TREM2 receptor pathway as a major pathology-induced immune signalling mediator.

### Single-cell and secretome atlas of human enteroendocrine cells

[Beumer *et al*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30501-8)
reports transcriptomics profiling and secretome analysis of human
enteroendocrine cells in a human organoid biobank.

### DNA of neutrophil extracellular traps promotes cancer metastasis via CCDC25

Neutrophils are cells in the blood that are promptly (within minutes) and
strongly activated upon infection by microorganisms. They have a very special
trick to clear microorganisms: they can secret neutrophil extracellular traps,
which consist of chromatin DNA filaments that are coated with proteins that are
usually stored in granules in the cells. These traps made of DNA and proteins
coat and lock the microorganisms so that the whole thing can be cleared by
phagocytotic cells like macrophages.

The traps, alas, seem not only provide advantage to the host, though. [Yang *et
al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2394-6) reported on *Nature*
that they found abundant such traps in the metastases, and the traps in the
serum can predict the occurrence of metastases. They report that DNA in the
traps, known as neutrophil-extracellular-trap (NET) DNA, attract cancer cells
rather than acting only as a &lsquo;trap&rsquo;. They found that the protein
[CCDC25](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2394-6) (coiled-coil domain
containing 25, GeneID 55246) acts as a NET-DNA sensor, which can act the
ILK-beta-parvin pathway to enhance cell motility.

They showed that NET-mediated metastasis can be abrogated in CCDC25-knockout
cells. The results suggest that targeting CCDC25 may be a therapeutic strategy
for the prevention of cancer metastasis.

A [News and
Views](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01672-3) article by Emma Nolan
and Ilaria Malanchi summarizes the findings.

### Notch3 drives synovial fibrosis and arthritis

The synovium, also known as the synovial membrane, is a connective tissue that
lines the inner surface of capsules of synovial joints and tendon sheath. It is
a mesenchymal tissue composed mainly of fibroblasts that surrounds the joints.

In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the synovial tissue gets enlarged substantially
(known as *hyperplasia*) and becomes inflamed and invasive so that it can
destroy the joint.

[Wei *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2222-z) reported on
*Nature* that [NOTCH3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/4854) (Notch receptor
3, GeneID 4854) signalling drives differentiation of fibroblasts that express
the CD90 protein, product of the [THY1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7070)
(Thy-1 cell surface antigen, GeneID 7070) gene. They used single-cell sequencing
and synovial tissue organoids to demonstrate that NOTCH3 signalling drives both
transcriptional and spatial gradients, spreading out (`emanating` as the authors
said) from vascular endothelial cells outwards in fibroblasts.

NOTCH3 itself and target genes of the Notch signaling pathways are upregulated
in synovial fibroblasts from patients of active rheumatoid arthritis. The link
between NOTCH3 and inflammatory arthritis is supported by mouse models. The
authors argue that synovial fibroblasts possess a positional identity which is
regulated by Notch signalling derived from endothelial cells. They suggest that
the crosstalk between endothelial cells and fibroblasts via Notch signalling
underlying inflammation and pathology in inflammatory arthritis. The results,
the authors reckoned, provide a molecular basis by which stromal cells, defined
as connective tissue cells of any organ, which usually include fibroblasts and
pericytes, can be therapeutically targeted in rheumatoid arthritis by modulation
of NOTCH3 signalling.

The study identified JAG2 and DLL4, both ligands of Notch3 signalling, expressed
in both synovial tissue and synovial organoid (Figure 3A). The RNA-sequencing
data is available at [ImmPort](https://ww.immport.org) under accession code
SDY1599 for human studies, and at the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession
code [GSE145286](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE145286).
Intermediate data (UMAP projections and normalized counts) are available at the
[single-cell portal of the Broad
Institute](https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP469). And the
code for data analysis is available on GitHub
[immunogenomics/notch](http://github.com/immunogenomics/notch).

## Programming

### Submitting Snakemake jobs to SLURM

I was often confused by the SLURM settings for Snakemake. One reason is that we
can specify resource requirements at different places:

1. Per rule level: `threads`.
1. Per workflow level: `cluster.json`, which can be read by Snakemake API in the
   `cluster` option:
    * `nodes`, in the form of `min-max`, specifies the minimum number and
	maximum number of nodes used *per job*.
    * `-n`, or `--ntasks`, advices how many tasks will be performed on each
	node. By default it is 1.
    * `-c`, or `--cpus-per-task`, advices how many CPUs each task needs, again
	*per job*. It is only an advise to tell slurm how to smartly allocate
	nodes. It does not limit the number of CPUs in use.
1. In case we use the [Snakemake API](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api_reference/snakemake.html), we can specify following parameters per workflow level: `cores`, `nodes`, `local_cores`, `resources`, and `default_resources`. In contrast to the settings passed `cluster`, they affect the workflow.

### Other programming tricks that I learned

* Often we have a list of strings in a tab-delimited file, like
    `S1,S2,S3,...,S10,...`, which we would like to sort by the numeric part of
    the string. The solution is to use `sort -V`. `-V` or `--version-sort`
    performs natural sort of (version) numbers within text. Source:
    [nitin@StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16945134/bash-sort-list-of-strings-by-number-at-the-end).
* `gensub` in `awk` can perform pattern matching and back reference. Below is an
    example. Source: [GNU manual of
    gawk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/String-Functions.html).

```bash
echo "S10_10" | awk '{
  a=gensub(/S(.+)_(.+)/, "\\1", "g");
  b=gensub(/S(.+)_(.+)/, "\\2", "g");
  print a,b;}'
## output: 10 10
```
