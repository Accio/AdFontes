*Doing now what patients need next* is the slogan of Roche. I think it is both a motivation and challenge for us who develop and use quantitative tools to contribute to drug discovery. It is a great feeling to do something that may translate into the benefit of patients and their families; how can we be sure that though what we do is exactly what they need next?

I keep thinking on and reading about the problem from time to time. Here is another recent interesting read, [Nature Reviews Drug Discovery's Interview with Daphne Koller](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-019-00115-7). Though her focus is on machine learning, I think several points she mentioned applies to virtually all quantitative aspects of drug discovery, including bioinformatics, computational biology and chemistry, modelling and simulation, *etc.*.

Three factors are critical for drug discovery to benefit from data: people, mindset, and communication.

One of the biggest obstacle that we face is that we lack people who are bilingual in mathematics/informatics and biology/chemistry/medicine. 

Data is more than a byproduct, it is an asset.
