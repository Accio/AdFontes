The chapter on pharmacokinetics covers following topics:

* IV Bolus - $$ C_{p} $$ versus time
* Clearance
* Volume of distribution
* Oral delivery

The key learning is the mathematical relationships between drug concentration in the plasma and time for both IV and oral drugs, as well as how clearance and volume of distribution determine the half-life of a drug.
