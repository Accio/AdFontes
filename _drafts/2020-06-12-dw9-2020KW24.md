## Biology

### mTOR regulates stress-induced mutagenesis

[Cipponi *et al.*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6495/1127)
reported on *Nature* their findings that mTOR regulates drug resistance.
Non-genotoxic drug selection leads to growth limiting stress, which activates
DNA damage response and inhibits mTOR signalling, which lead to less accurate
DNA repair. The net effect is an increase of genetic diversity and drug
resistance.

Using multiple small molecules that target several targets and genome-wide shRNA
screening, the team identified mTOR as a common evolutionary capacitor, namely
knock-down of genes positively regulating mTOR activity increases genetic
diversity. They found that inhibition of mTOR fosters adaptive mutagenesis by
repressing accurate DNA repair.

The final figure (Figure 4) of the paper shows the dynamic change of the fitness
landscape of cancer cells under pharmacological pressure. In the first phase of
adaptation, which takes about 35-45 weeks (shorter than a month), an equilibrium
is gradually established between damages induced by the deleterious effect
conferred by initial genomic instability and the beneficial effect conferred by
resistant genomic configurations. The equilibrium is reached in the second phase
of the response.

### Nearly PAM-less CRIPSR-Cas9

The CRISPR-Cas9 system of genome editing requires that a short sequence of 2-6
base pairs, known as the [protospacer adjacent motif
(PAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protospacer_adjacent_motif), immediately
follows the DNA sequence targeted by the Cas9 nuclease.

In bacteria, PAM is used to distinguish self from non-self DNA, preventing the
CRISPR locus from being targeted and destroyed by the nuclease. In the context
of genome editing, if the target DNA sequence is not followed by the PAM
sequence, Cas9 will not bind to or cleave the target DNA sequence. Some
disease-causing genes, therefore, are not amenable to CRISPR-Cas9 editing.

[Walton *et al.*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6488/290) (Science,
2020) and [Chatterjee *et
al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0517-0) (Nature Biotechnology,
2020) reported engineered Cas9 enzyme variants that have less requirement about
the PAM sequences. While Walton used structure information of Cas9-DNA binding
to perform mutagenesis to relax Cas9 PAM preference, Chatterjee started by
comparing orthologues of Cas9 and identified a mutation (threonine, abbreviated
as `T`, uncharged, to lysine, abbreviated as `K`, positively charged) and a
positively charged loop sequence that reduce the stringency of PAM dependency
and improve the targeting breadth and efficiency of the Cas9 enzyme.

Figure 2b of Chatterjee *et al.* is especially interesting, which shows that
their variant of Cas9 (Sc++ and HiFi-Sc++) show comparable or reduced off-target
potential compared with the original Cas9 enzyme. And the off-target potential
is dependent on the target: while editing of *VEGFA* ([Vascular endothelial
growth factor A](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/7422), Entrez Gene ID 7422) with
Sc++ induces more than 30 off-target sites with less than 6 mismatches (6 in
case of HiFi-Sc++), editing *EMX1* ([empty spiracles homeobox
1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/2016). Gene ID 2016) with HiFi-Sc++ induced
only 6 off-target sites (0 in case of HiFi-Sc++).

Both studies provide new tools for genome editing. Off-target effects and
editing efficiency remain challenges of using these tools in therapeutic
settings.

## Mathematics and machine learning

The mathematician Weinan E gave a talk on *SIAM Mathematics of Data Science
Conference* with the title *A mathematical perspective of of Machine Learning*.
The recording is available on
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PKudVGz4GM&list=PLcntFj46o5pFBKIGgKJ55q10D5pYc8JOu&index=8).
