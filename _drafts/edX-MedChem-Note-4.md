Chapter four sheds lights on enzymes, which represents a large class of targets of small-molecules.

## Michaelis-Menten kinetics

This part is covered well by biochemical introductory texts. It is essential to fully understand (one form of) the Michaelis-Menten equation:

$$ V = \frac{V_{max} \times [S]}{K_m+[S]} $$

where $$ V $$ represents **v**elocity of the reaction, $$ [S] $$ represents the concentration of the **s**ubstrate, and $$ K\_m $$ represents the Michaelis-Menten constant, which equals the substrate concentration at which $$ V $$ reaches half of $$ V_{max} $$, which represents half of the theoretically maximum velocity of the reaction.

Once this equation is understood, its linear transformation, the Lineweaver-Burk equation, is easy to understand:

$$ \frac{1}{V} = \frac{K_m}{V_{max}} \times \frac{1}{[S]} + \frac{1}{V_{max}} $$
