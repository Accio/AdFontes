Why do we care about TCR sequencing? What tools are available to analyse TCR
sequencing data? Here are some basics.

## T cell receptor

T cell receptor, or TCR, is generated through random rearrangement of genomic
loci. The loci are known as V (variable) region, the D (diversity) region, and
the J (joining) region. The rearrangement is therefore sometimes called V(D)J
rearrangement.

The process of V(D)J rearrangement can be visually expressed in the following
graphic (source: Wikimedia).
