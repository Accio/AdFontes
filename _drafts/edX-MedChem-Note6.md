Module three consists of chapter six (blood and drug transport) and chapter seven (pharmacokinetics). This module deals with the absorption and distribution of small-molecule drugs. While the previous modules were more about biochemistry, physical chemistry seems to be more relevant for this module.

Module three is closely related with module four, which is about metabolism of the drugs.
