Module three consists of chapter six (blood and drug transport) and chapter seven (pharmacokinetics). This module deals with the absorption and distribution of small-molecule drugs. While the previous modules were more about biochemistry, physical chemistry seems to be more relevant for this module.

Module three is closely related with module four, which is about metabolism of the drugs.

## Blood

Understanding blood is important for drug discovery for two reasons: (1) blood is the vehicle to transport drugs within the body, and (2) blood is often used to determine drug concentration in the body.

Roughly speaking the blood consists of red blood cells, white blood cells, and the blood plasma that contains high concentrations of proteins, electrolytes, *etc*.. Hits can be screened with plasma to downprioritise compounds that bind strongly to blood proteins and prioritise compounds that bind less.
