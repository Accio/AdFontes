Module three consists of chapter six (blood and drug transport) and chapter seven (pharmacokinetics). This module deals with the absorption and distribution of small-molecule drugs. While the previous modules were more about biochemistry, physical chemistry seems to be more relevant for this module.

Module three is closely related with module four, which is about metabolism of the drugs.

## Blood

Understanding blood is important for drug discovery for two reasons: (1) blood is the vehicle to transport drugs within the body, and (2) blood is often used to determine drug concentration in the body.

A 70-kg human has an approximate blood volume of 5L.

Roughly speaking the blood consists of red blood cells (~45%), white blood cells (~1%), and the blood plasma (~54%) that contains high concentrations of proteins, electrolytes, hormones, *etc*.. Hits can be screened with plasma to downprioritise compounds that bind strongly to blood proteins and prioritise compounds that bind less.

A few numbers of a 70-kg patient
* Whole blood: 5L
* Plastma 2.7L
* Interstitial fluid, liquid that sits between the cells of the body, 10L.
* Intracellular fuild, the total water found in the body, which includes the cellular volume of the whole blood, 25L. Only drugs that can cross a cell membrane will have access to the intracellular fluid.
* Total body water, 38L
* Body volume, approximately 70L

Proteins that are extensively high expressed in plasma may bind drug and therefore reducing concentration of drug that reaches the desired target. Examples include
* Albumin (~5% weight of blood), which binds particularly strongly to acid drugs such as warfarin and ibuprotein (>99%)
* Globulins (~2.5% weight of blood). $ \alpha_{1} $-acid glyocoprotein tends to bind basic drugs, such as disopyramide and lidocaine (~70%)
