Three stages of molecular phenotypic drug discovery: 
* Computational phenotyping of drug candidates (integrative analysis of omics data such as transcriptomics,proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and drug-target information to predict cell-type specific phenotype of a drug candidate)
* Molecular Phenotyping, a real-world check to identify molecular-level mechanisms of drugs in both simple and advanced in vitro systems
* Preclinical safety studies and clinical trials

Challenges:
* High-dimensionality of the optimization problem - the classic [von Neumann's elephant problem](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/25/phenotypic-screening-the-state-of-the-art) as pointed out by Derek Lowe in his [*In the Pipeline* blog](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/25/phenotypic-screening-the-state-of-the-art). 
* The variability associated with *in vitro* systems as well as with their predictability of *in vivo* needs rigorous testing and scrutinization.
* We need an infrastructure that allows drug discovers making timely diciscions, and deals with long-tail phenomena whereby there is lots of data on some compounds (targets, individuals, etc.) while little data on most compounds (targets, individuals, etc.). This was inspired by Michael Jordan's blog post [Artificial Intelligence — The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7)
