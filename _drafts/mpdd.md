Three stages of molecular phenotypic drug discovery: 
* Computational phenotyping of drug candidates (integrative analysis of omics data such as transcriptomics,proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and drug-target information to predict cell-type specific phenotype of a drug candidate)
* Molecular Phenotyping, a real-world check to identify molecular-level mechanisms of drugs in both simple and advanced in vitro systems
* Preclinical safety studies and clinical trials
