[Molecular Phenotyping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_phenotyping) characterises drug candidates by profiling pathway reporter genes, i.e. pre-selected genes that are modulated specifically by human metabolic and signaling pathways, in cellular systems in order to infer drug-induced modulation of these pathways, which may predict late-onset phenotypes *in vitro* and *in vivo*.

A pilot study of molecular phenotyping was published last year, as covery story of the Cell Chemical Biology journal (2017 April Issue): [Molecular Phenotyping Combines Molecular Information, Biological Relevance, and Patient Data to Improve Productivity of Early Drug Discovery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451945617300995).

My colleagues and I work towards stronger integration of molecular phenotyping into drug-discovery pieplines. We envision further integration may leads to *molecular phenotypic drug discovery* that empowers both target-based and phenotype-based drug discovery processes.

In my opinion, there are three major components of molecular phenotypic drug discovery: 

* Computational phenotyping of drug candidates (integrative analysis of omics data such as transcriptomics,proteomics, pharmacogenomics, and drug-target information to predict cell-type specific phenotype of a drug candidate).
* Molecular Phenotyping, a real-world check to identify molecular-level mechanisms of drugs in both simple and advanced in vitro systems, including iPS-derived cells and organoids/organ-on-a-chip systems and alike.
* Preclinical safety studies and clinical trials.

In contrast to classical, linear drug-discovery pipelines, the ideal information flow in molecular phenotypic drug discovery is not one-directional, but rather circular. While computational phenotyping provides predictions for molecular phenotyping, and molecular phenotyping serves as surrogates of preclinical safety studies and clinical trials, information collected in downstream stages have to be fed back to upstream stages in order to continuously improve the process.


We are likely to face several challenges when promoting molecular phenotypic drug discovery.

* High-dimensionality of the optimization problem - the classic [von Neumann's elephant problem](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/25/phenotypic-screening-the-state-of-the-art) as pointed out by Derek Lowe in his [*In the Pipeline* blog](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2017/07/25/phenotypic-screening-the-state-of-the-art). 
* The variability associated with *in vitro* systems as well as with their predictability of *in vivo* needs rigorous testing and scrutinization.
* We need an infrastructure that allows drug discovers making timely diciscions, and deals with long-tail phenomena whereby there is lots of data on some compounds (targets, individuals, etc.) while little data on most compounds (targets, individuals, etc.). This was inspired by Michael Jordan's blog post [Artificial Intelligence — The Revolution Hasn’t Happened Yet](https://medium.com/@mijordan3/artificial-intelligence-the-revolution-hasnt-happened-yet-5e1d5812e1e7).
