I read the book *Nonviolent communication* (the 3rd edition) by Marshall B.
Rosenberg. Here are my learning notes.

The author introduces the nonviolent communication (NVC) as a four-step process:

1. **Observing**: the concrete actions that we observe that affect our well-being.
2. **Feeling**: identify the feeling we have in relation to what we observe.
3. **Finding the needs**: the needs, values, desires, *etc.* that create our feelings.
4. **Request**: the concrete actions we request in order to enrich our lives.

The many poems and lyrics by the author and Ruth Bebermeyer, a colleague of him,
added human touch and rhythmic beauty to the book.
