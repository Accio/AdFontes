Here are some discoveries that fascinate me this week.

I recorded this week *Sonatina* by James Hook (1746-1827), an English composer
and organist, with the indication *Allegro non troppo*, which means *fast, but
not too fast*. In case you like the recording, please feel free to share it.

## Biology

### Accelerating Cancer Immunotherapy Research (ACIR)

I encountered a website that brings researchers to the latest development of
cancer immune therapy, the [ACIR](http://acir.org). It aggregates latest
publications and research news about (cancer) immunology and summarizes them in
compact articles. I recommend it to people who are interested in the topic.

For instance, [TOX is so
exhausting](https://acir.org/weekly-digests/2019/july/tox-is-so-exhausting), a
post in July 2019, summarizes five publications about the mechanism how
transcription factor [TOX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9760) (thymocyte
selection associated high mobility group box) contributes to the formation of
exhausted CD8+ T cells via chromatin remodelling and alteration of RNA
transcriptome. I learned a lot about T cell exhaustion in cancer immunotherapy
by reading the summary.

### Other gems in biology

* [Starr *et al.*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.157982v1)
    around Jesse Bloom at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center reported a
    library of single-amino acid mutants of the ACE2 receptor binding region of
    the SARS-nCov-2 virus. It was also covered by Derek Lowe's blog post [A Wide
    Look at Coronavirus
    Mutants](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/19/a-wide-look-at-coronavirus-mutants).
* [Young blood and old
    blood](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/12/young-blood-and-old-blood)
    in the *In The Pipeline* blog introduced two recent publications about
    attempts to reset genome methylation to turn back the aging clock (coming
    from a start-up and people in Horvath's group at UCLA), referring to the
    preprint [*Reversing age: dual species measurement of epigenetic age with a
    single clock*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.082917v1).
* Much research seems being done in the field of aging. [Amor *et
    al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2403-9) reported on
    *Nature* their use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to target
    senescent cells, using the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
    (uPAR, official gene name [PLAUR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5329))
    as a cell-surface protein marker of senescent cells. They showed elongated
    survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, and improved homeostasis
    in a mouse model of liver fibrosis.
* [Griffiths *et al.*](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/19/1918937117)
    reported on *PNAS* their effort of profiling peripheral immune cell
    abundance in time series following treatment of immunotherapy in a small
    clinical trial. They used mathematical modelling used in ecology to
    characterize how immune cells interact and attach tumour and correlate to
    pathway activity.

## Computational biology

### Evaluating single-cell structure preservation by dimensionality reduction

[Heiser and
Lau](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124720305258)
evaluated dimension-reduction techniques. They showed that input cell
distribution (the biology of the cells, I would say) is the most dominant
factor, followed by method parameters. My takeaway, though not surprisingly, is
that the applicability is technology- and data-specific, and there are no
universally applicable models. Among the tested methods, UMAP and t-SNE, two
commonly used methods, give very similar results.

### Mathematical oncology

I discovered an interesting blog and email list on mathematical oncology,
[Mathematical Oncology](http://mathematical-oncology.org/), created by [Jeffery
West](http://jeffreybwest.com/) and colleagues. It sends weekly emails about
progress in mathematical oncology (RSS is also possible). Given the large amount
of data and relative good funding of oncology compared with other disease
indications, the modelling approach there can be interesting for other disease
areas as well.

## Programming

### Jupyter nbconvert

The following command can be used to run a Jupyter notebook from the command
line, making changes in place.

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600 --to notebook
  --inplace --execute standard_workflow_besca2.0.ipynb
```

The `--ExecutePreprocessor.timeout=600` option tells the program that each cell
can run at maximum 600 seconds. The output will be written in the notebook (`--
to notebook --inplace`).

More can learned from [the execute API of Jupyter nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute_api.html).

## Other gems

### Researchers and founders

The [blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/researchers-and-founders) by Sam
Altman summarizes his experience working with researcher and founders. A
relevant [blog post](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)
by John Schulman reflects some habits shared by successful researchers in the
field of machine learning.

Some key points that I took:

* The most productive founders and researchers keep pondering upon the Hamming's
  question: &lsquo;what are the most important problems in your field, and why
  aren’t you working on them?&rsquo; Honing the taste about problems is an
  important skill that we need to learn all the time.
* An effective researcher or founder needs both laser-sharp focus upon what is
  coming next and long-term vision. There can be &lsquo;idea-driven&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;goal-driven&rsquo; approach to research. I agree with John Schulman
  that &lsquo;goal-driven&rsquo; approach may be a more practical one for people
  working in a team.
* Being persistent and working hard makes it more likely to be successful. I
  wonder how that can be combined with a role in the family and a role for the
  society. Maybe the answer is that we have to work as much as our physical and
  mental health, our family, and our social need can support.
* Allocate time for broad-scope learning and personal development.
* Effective people bias towards action and trying things, and being honest about
  what works and  what does not work.
* Effective people are more creative and generating more ideas.
* Productive people value autonomy, and are not confined by the rules that make
    little sense for them.
* The motivations can be complex - often driven by genuine curiosity.

### DNA surveillance in China

According to [*New York
Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html),
China is collecting DNA information from 10% of men and boys. The topic was also
covered by
[Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/china-expands-dna-data-grab-in-troubled-western-region-1.22033).

### Predicting mortality

Is death a predictable event? It seems that for some degree, it may be.
[Puterman *et al.*](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/06/16/1918455117)
reported on *PNAS* their findings by building statistical models of mortality
using more than 50 factors.

The following figure (Figure 3) tells much of the story. The higher the hazard
ratio, the more likely that the factor causes death.

If we take the correlation as causality, which can be totally wrong, here are
the things that we can do to ourselves and to others if the goal is to live
longer (that may not be the only goal of life though):

1. Do not smoke. Never.
1. If possible, do not drink alcohol. If impossible, do it with caution.
1. Exercise.
1. Sleep well.
1. Get education.
1. Plan your career, finance and wealth (it may not be in our control, though).
1. Know your neighbours.
1. Spend time with spouse, friends, and family you cherish.
1. Find a purpose in life (that takes a life, boy, I was told).
1. Become satisfied with what you get in life.
1. Stay conscientious, namely being careful, diligent (hard-working and
   focused), is about as important as being optimistic.
1. Give ourselves and others hope, not discrimination.

It sounds almost mundane, right? The conclusions are largely consistent the
other study about [happiness and
sadness](https://accio.github.io/discoveryweekly/2020/06/05/dw8-2020KW23.html#happiness-and-sadness-quantified).
There may be more things that the numbers and the statistical models can tell
us. And it helps if we can quantify the contribution of individual factors as
the authors of the paper did, despite that some factors are strongly correlated
via latent variables. The real challenge is how to live up to them as often
 and as well as we can, given events and changes in life. That is a game that
 restarts everyday.

### Turtles and tortoises are in trouble

[Turtles and tortoises are in
trouble](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220306369) is
a review authored by Stanford *et al.* and published in *Current Biology*. It
sheds light on the urgent extinction pressure of turtles (which mainly live in
waters) and tortoises (which mainly live on the land), which are known
collectively as chelonians. The bleak prediction goes that many species will go
extinct this century.
