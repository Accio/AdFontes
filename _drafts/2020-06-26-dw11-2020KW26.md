Here are some discoveries that fascinate me this week.

## Accelerating Cancer Immunotherapy Research (ACIR)

I encountered a website that brings researchers to the latest development of
cancer immune therapy, the [ACIR](http://acir.org). It aggregates latest
publications and research news about (cancer) immunology and summarizes them in
compact articles. I recommend it to people who are interested in the topic.

For instance, [TOX is so
exhausting](https://acir.org/weekly-digests/2019/july/tox-is-so-exhausting), a
post in July 2019, summarizes five publications about the mechanism how
transcription factor [TOX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9760) (thymocyte
selection associated high mobility group box) contributes to the formation of
exhausted CD8+ T cells via chromatin remodelling and alteration of RNA
transcriptome.

### Other gems in biology

* [Starr *et al.*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.17.157982v1)
    around Jesse Bloom at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center reported a
    library of single-amino acid mutants of the ACE2 receptor binding region of
    the SARS-nCov-2 virus. It was also covered by Derek Lowe's blog post [A Wide
    Look at Coronavirus
    Mutants](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/19/a-wide-look-at-coronavirus-mutants).
* [Young blood and old
    blood](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2020/06/12/young-blood-and-old-blood)
    in the *In The Pipeline* blog introduced two recent publications about
    attempts to reset genome methylation to turn back the aging clock (coming
    from a start-up and people in Horvath's group at UCLA), referring to the
    preprint [*Reversing age: dual species measurement of epigenetic age with a
    single clock*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.082917v1).
* Much research seems being done in the field of aging. [Amor *et
    al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2403-9) reported on
    *Nature* their use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells to target
    senescent cells, using the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor
    (uPAR, official gene name [PLAUR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/5329))
    as a cell-surface protein marker of senescent cells. They showed elongated
    survival in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, and improved homeostasis
    in a mouse model of liver fibrosis.

## Researchers and founders

The [blog post](https://blog.samaltman.com/researchers-and-founders) by Sam
Altman summarizes his experience working with researcher and founders. A
relevant [blog post](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html)
by John Schulman reflects some habits shared by successful researchers in the
field of machine learning.

Some key points that I took:

* The most productive founders and researchers keep pondering upon the Hamming's
  question: &lsquo;what are the most important problems in your field, and why
  arenâ€™t you working on them?&rsquo; Honing the taste about problems is an
  important skill that we need to learn all the time.
* An effective researcher or founder needs both laser-sharp focus upon what is
  coming next and long-term vision. There can be &lsquo;idea-driven&rsquo; or
  &lsquo;goal-driven&rsquo; approach to research. I agree with John Schulman
  that &lsquo;goal-driven&rsquo; approach may be a more practical one for people
  working in a team.
* Being persistent and working hard makes it more likely to be successful. I
  wonder how that can be combined with a role in the family and a role for the
  society. Maybe the answer is that we have to work as much as our physical and
  mental health, our family, and our social need can support.
* Allocate time for broad-scope learning and personal development.
* Effective people bias towards action and trying things, and being honest about
  what works and  what does not work.
* Effective people are more creative and generating more ideas.
* Productive people value autonomy, and are not confined by the rules that make
    little sense for them.
* The motivations can be complex - often driven by genuine curiosity.

## DNA surveillance in China

According to [*New York
Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html),
China is collecting DNA information from 10% of men and boys. The topic was also
covered by
[Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/china-expands-dna-data-grab-in-troubled-western-region-1.22033).
