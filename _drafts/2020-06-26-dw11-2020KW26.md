Here are some discoveries that fascinate me this week.

## Accelerating Cancer Immunotherapy Research (ACIR)

I encountered a website that brings researchers to the latest development of
cancer immune therapy, the [ACIR](http://acir.org). It aggregates latest
publications and research news about (cancer) immunology and summarizes them in
compact articles. I recommend it to people who are interested in the topic.

For instance, [TOX is so
exhausting](https://acir.org/weekly-digests/2019/july/tox-is-so-exhausting), a
post in July 2019, summarizes five publications about the mechanism how
transcription factor [TOX](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/9760) (thymocyte
selection associated high mobility group box) contributes to the formation of
exhausted CD8+ T cells via chromatin remodelling and alteration of RNA
transcriptome.

# Other gems

* [DNA surveillance in
    China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/world/asia/China-DNA-surveillance.html):
    According to *New York Times* China is collecting DNA information from 10%
    of men and boys. The topic was also covered by
    [Nature](https://www.nature.com/news/china-expands-dna-data-grab-in-troubled-western-region-1.22033).
