## Thoughts on corporate research

I read a post on the [decline of corporate research labs and research
productivity](https://blog.dshr.org/2020/05/the-death-of-corporate-research-labs.html).

The decline and death of corporate research in America, such as the Bell lab
and the Xerox lab, happened at the same when university research generated more
outputs and policies encouraged acquisition and merging more than research and
innovation.

According to the authors, the situation is particularly alarming because
corporate research labs do contribute unique values, for instance, they (1) work
on general-purpose technologies, (2) solve practical problems, (3) are
multi-disciplinary and have more resources, (4) may general more external
benefits, namely benefits to the society and research community, than benefits
only for the company.

I was impressed by the paper [*The changing structure of American innovation:
Some cautionary remarks for economic
growth*](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/593d9b08be65945a2e878544/t/5d31ac9b33ae9b0001d88216/1563536539717/c14259.pdf)
by Arora *et al.*, a working paper of National Bureau of Economic Research. I
think anyone who wishes to work or is working in industrial research labs may
benefit from reading it.

By reviewing the ecosystem of innovation in America over the past century, the
authors observed that

> The  past  three  decades  have  been  marked  by  a  growing division of
> labor between universities focusing on research and large corporations
> focusing on development. Knowledge produced by universities is not often in a
> form that can be readily digested and turned into new goods and services.
> Small firms and university technology transfer offices cannot fully substitute
> for corporate research, which had integrated multiple disciplines at the scale
> required to solve significant technical problems.

The authors argue that while the division of labour increased the volume of
scientific publications by the universities, it has slowed the transformation
of knowledge into products and processes, at least for a certain period of
time.
