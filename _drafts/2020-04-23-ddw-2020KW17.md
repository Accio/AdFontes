Here are the things I discovered this week that fascinates me.

## Computational biology

I discovered this interesting event by the newsletter of Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM): [NCI-DOE collaboration 2020 Ideas Lab: toward building a cancer patient "digital twin"](https://events.cancer.gov/cbiit/dtwin2020/). Unfortunately, researchers in industry are not eligible to apply. However, I find the idea of building a digital twin of a cancer patient daring and interesting, and it is particularly interesting that the idea lab aims to bring mathematical, active learning, and ensemble model approaches together. Therefore, it is an interesting approach to bring mechanistic modelling, machine learning, and multi-scale modelling together. **The application deadline is April 30th, 2017**. 

Following the paper last week about binary protein interactions in human, a new
paper on *Cell Systems* reports protein-protein interactions that are found in
mouse brain: [BraInMap Elucidates the Macromolecular Connectivity Landscape of Mammalian Brain](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(20)30109-5). I was impressed by the identification of a 28-member (!) RNA binding complex that the authors suggested to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. I wonder what would be the difference between human and mouse version of the dataset, how dynamic and stochastic this network is in reality, and whether it is possible to generate hypotheses about drug targets by integrating such protein-protein interaction data and single-cell or even spatial-resolved RNA expression data. Until we have answers to those questions, the resource can be checked out here: https://www.bu.edu/dbin/cnsb/mousebrain/. 

## Drug discovery

## Disease biology

## Writing

## Software projects

## Reading


And thanks to the spring clean-up of a kind neighbour, I got a free copy of *Fühlen, Denken,
Handeln* (German) by Gerhard Roth. I was attracted by the introduction and am
reading it.

## Other gems

    way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric S. Raymond.
