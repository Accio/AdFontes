Here are the things I discovered this week that fascinates me.

## Computational biology

I discovered this interesting event by the newsletter of Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM): [NCI-DOE collaboration 2020 Ideas Lab: toward building a cancer patient "digital twin"](https://events.cancer.gov/cbiit/dtwin2020/). Unfortunately, researchers in industry are not eligible to apply. However, I find the idea of building a digital twin of a cancer patient daring and interesting, and it is particularly interesting that the idea lab aims to bring mathematical, active learning, and ensemble model approaches together. Therefore, it is an interesting approach to bring mechanistic modelling, machine learning, and multi-scale modelling together.

## Drug discovery

## Disease biology

## Writing

## Software projects

## Reading


And thanks to the spring clean-up of a kind neighbour, I got a free copy of *Fühlen, Denken,
Handeln* (German) by Gerhard Roth. I was attracted by the introduction and am
reading it.

## Other gems

* [How to ask questions the smart
    way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric S. Raymond.
* [Piano and math tutorials on
    line](https://sites.google.com/site/pianoandmathtutorials/home) by Jane.
* [Mathematical epidemiology: How to model a
    pandemic](https://phys.org/news/2020-03-mathematical-epidemiology-pandemic.html)
    on Phys.org, by Christian Yates.
* [Bach Cello Suite 1 Präludium, Symphony Orchestra Basel (from living rooms)](https://vimeo.com/406770215).

Happy weekend!
