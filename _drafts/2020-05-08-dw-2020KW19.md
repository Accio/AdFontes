## Computer science

### The StellarGraph Machine Learning Library

[StellarGraph](https://github.com/stellargraph/stellargraph) is a python library
for machine learning on graphs and networks.

Typical applications include

* Representation learning for nodes and edges, used for visualization and
    down-stream machine-learning tasks
* Node or edge class prediction
* Classification of graphs
* Link prediction

## Computational Biology

### Inferring spatial and signaling relationships from single-cell data

[Cang and Nie](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15968-5) reported
their effect to use tools from optimal transport, a mathematical branch that
gained much attention recently in many fields including biology, to recover
spatial relationship from single-cell data using spatial measurements of a small
number of genes.

The method may be useful to integrate non-spatial with spatial data, and to
infer dynamic signalling events using spatial data.

### Other interesting papers

* The software[*Souporcell*](https://github.com/wheaton5/souporcell), covered in
  the *Nature Methods* publication by [Heaton *et
  al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0820-1), clusters
  mixed-genotype single-cell RNA sequencing data by individual.

## Biology

### Structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-Cov-2 bound to remdesivir

There is quite some debating ongoing about the clinical efficacy of remdesivir
against the new corona virus (SARS-Cov-2). While the study by [Yin *et
al*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/30/science.abc1560),
published online on May 1st on *Science*, does not provide a conclusion to the
debate, it gives us some hint how remdesivir binds to its supposed target,
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

The structure, collected by cryo-EM imaging at the resolution of about ~2.5
Angstrom ($10^-10$m), reveals that remdesivir inserts itself into the primer
strand of RNA synthesis at the first base and terminates chain elongation. The
insights may help to make more specific and efficacious RdRp inhibitors.

### SARS-Cov-2 infects human gut enterocytes

[Lamers *et
al.*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/30/science.abc1669)
reported on *Science* that the new corona virus infects human gut enterocytes.
They used human intestinal organoid systems and both confocal- and
electron-microscopy to demonstrate the infection. The authors also used bulk
RNA-seq to show that cytokines and interferon response genes are positively
regulated by viral infection, which fits our understanding of a generic viral
response.

The bulk RNA-seq data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus, with the
accession ID
[GSE149312](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149312).

### A 3D brain model infected by HSV develops Alzheimer-Disease-like phenotypes

There has been a few studies suggesting a correlation between viral infection
and the Alzheimer Disease (AD). A definitive causal link is missing. It may take
a few years, when not decades, until a causal link can be confirmed or rejected.

An alternative way to support the viral hypothesis is to build a viral infection
model that mimics the pathogenesis and phenotypes of AD in human brain. [Cairns
*et al.*](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/19/eaay8828) reported on
*Science Advances* such a model.

They built a 3D model using human-induced neural stem cells infected by Herpes
Simplex Virus Type I (HSV-1). They reported phenotypes that resemble AD,
including amyloid plaque-like formations, gliosis, neuroinflammation, and
decreased functionality.

While the model does not prove the viral hypothesis, it provides a platform to
identify drugs that reverse HSV-1 induced phenotype. Whether such drugs can
indeed halt or stop the progression of AD is another tough question.

### Other interesting papers

* [Gordon *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2286-9) reported
  on *Nature* a protein interaction map of SARS-Cov-2. The work is supervised
  among others by Brian Shoichet and Nevan Krogan.
* [Eshraghi1 *et al.*](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/eaaz7001)
    reported their findings on *Science Advances* that RasGRP1 ([RAS guanyl
    release protein factor 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10125)) controls
    the development of L-DOPA induced dyskenisia (involuntary muscle movements).
    Inhibiting RasGRP1 may reduce the side effects associated with L-DOPA
    treatment.
* [Brook *et al.*](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/12/542/eaax4517) reported
    that Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination induced granulocyte
    colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) within hours of administration. It drove
    *de novo* generation of neutrophils in the process known as emergency
    granulopoiesis (EG, reviewed by [Manz and
    Boettcher](https://www.nature.com/articles/nri3660) in Nature Reviews
    Immunology, 2014). Increased neutrophils protects from sepsis in mice. And
    increased neutrophils were observed in human infants as well. Previous
    studies reported an interesting negative correlation between BCG vaccination
    status and nCov-19 mortality in many countries. Whether EG plays a role
    there is not known.
* [Wireless recording from unrestrained monkeys reveals moto goal encoding
    beyond immediate reach in frontoparietal
    cortex](https://elifesciences.org/articles/51322): reach goals beyond
    immediate reach by thoughts? That works at least on two rhesus monkeys.

## Other gems

* [Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera is available for 50$](
  https://techxplore.com/news/2020-05-raspberry-pi-unveils-interchangeable-lens-camera.html).
  It supports interchangeable lenses and offers a 12.3 mega-pixel sensor. It is
  available for 60 CHF in Switzerland from
  [Pi-Shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/hq-camera).
* [JukeBox by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/), a neural network that
  generates both music and voice. The songs sounded indeed like being generated
  by AI, but the idea is interesting.
* [Ionic gelatin as a wearable energy source](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/29/science.aaz5045).
* Following last week's reading on Ruan Yiweng's blog, I tried and installed
    [pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole). I am excited about it. It is
    a DNS sinkhole, which provides network-wide ad blocking via my own Linux
    hardware. Please consider donation and spreading the word if you find the
    tool useful, too.
* [leeoniya/uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) on GitHub: a small and
    fast chart for time series, lines, *etc*. MIT licensed.
* I migrated from keepassx to [keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/) to manage my
    passwords and credentials. So far it looks good.
* I used [proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint) to check my writing
    styles, and liked it. Now, I discovered an interface to various of linters
    in vim: [vim-syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic). I used
    it and liked it, too. Different from proselint, which checks only writing,
    `vim-syntastic` allows file checking with any external tools. For markdown
    files, the [syntastic
    manual](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/blob/master/doc/syntastic-checkers.txt)
    about checkers listed following linters: `mdl` (markdown lint tool),
    `proselint`, `remark-lint`, and `textlint`.
* Another vim plug-in I found useful for writing prose
    is [reedes/vim-pencil](reedes/vim-pencil).
* [Hause concert at the Palace Bellevue Berlin, Ludwid van Beethoven: Waldstein
  Sonata op.53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC8DBTfJI90) by Igor Levit on
  youtube. It calmed some part in me while excited other parts. An amazing
  performance.
