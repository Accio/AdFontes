## Computational Biology

### Inferring spatial and signaling relationships between cells from single cell transcriptomic data

[Cang and Nie](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15968-5) reported
their effect to use tools from optimal transport, a mathematical branch that
gained much attention recently in many fields including biology, to recover
spatial relationship from single-cell data using spatial measurements of a small
number of genes. 

The method may be useful to integrate non-spatial with spatial data, and to
infer dynamic signalling events using spatial data.

## Biology

### Structure of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-Cov-2 bound to remdesivir.

There is quite some debating ongoing about the clinical efficacy of remdesivir against the new corona virus (SARS-Cov-2). While the study by [Yin *et al*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/30/science.abc1560), published online on May 1st on *Science*, does not provide a conclusion to the debate, it gives us some hint how remdesivir binds to its supposed target, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). 

The structure, collected by cryo-EM imaging at the resolution of about ~2.5 Angstrom ($10^-10$m), reveals that remdesivir inserts itself into the primer strand of RNA synthesis at the first base and terminates chain elongation. The insights may help to make more specific and efficacious RdRp inhibitors.

### SARS-Cov-2 infects human gut enterocytes

[Lamers *et
al.*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/30/science.abc1669) reported on *Science* that the new corona virus infects human gut enterocytes. They used human intestinal organoid systems and both confocal- and electron-microscopy to demonstrate the infection. The authors also used bulk RNA-seq to show that cytokines and interferon response genes are positively regulated by viral infection, which fits our understanding of a generic viral response. 

The bulk RNA-seq data is available at Gene Expression Omnibus, with the accession ID [GSE149312](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE149312).

### Other interesting papers

* [Gordon *et al.*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2286-9) reported on *Nature* a protein interaction map of SARS-Cov-2. The work is supervised among others by Brian Shoichet and Nevan Krogan.
* [Eshraghi1 *et al.*](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/18/eaaz7001)
    reported their findings on *Science Advances* that RasGRP1 ([RAS guanyl
    release protein factor 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/10125)) controls the development of L-DOPA induced
    dyskenisia (involuntary muscle movements). Inhibiting RasGRP1 may reduce the
    side effects associated with L-DOPA treatment.

# Other gems

* [Raspberry Pi High-Quality Camera is available for 50$](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-05-raspberry-pi-unveils-interchangeable-lens-camera.html). It supports interchangeable lenses and offers a 12.3 mega-pixel sensor. It is available for 60 CHF in Switzerland from [Pi-Shop.ch](https://www.pi-shop.ch/hq-camera).
* [JukeBox by OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/), a neural network that
    generates both music and voice.
* [Ionic gelatin as a wearable energy
    source](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/29/science.aaz5045)
* Following last week's reading on Ruan Yiweng's blog, I tried and installed
    [pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole). I am excited about it. It is
    a DNS sinkhole, which provides network-wide ad blocking via my own Linux
    hardware. Please consider donation and spreading the word if you find the
    tool useful, too.
* [leeoniya/uPlot](https://github.com/leeoniya/uPlot) on GitHub: a small and
    fast chart for time series, lines, *etc*. MIT licensed.
* I migrated from keepassx to [keepassxc](https://keepassxc.org/) to manage my
    passwords and credentials. So far it looks good.
* I used [proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint) to check my writing
    styles, and liked it. Now, I discovered an interface to various of linters
    in vim: [vim-syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic). I used
    it and liked it, too. Different from proselint, which checks only writing,
    `vim-syntastic` allows file checking with any external tools. For markdown
    files, the [syntastic
    manual](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic/blob/master/doc/syntastic-checkers.txt)
    about checkers listed following linters: `mdl` (markdown lint tool),
    `proselint`, `remark-lint`, and `textlint`.
* Another vim plug-in I found useful for writing prose
    is [reedes/vim-pencil](reedes/vim-pencil).
