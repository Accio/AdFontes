Chapter Three focuses on protein structures. From amino acids, via primary, secondary, and tertiary structure, up to quaternary structure and X-ray crystallography, our understanding of proteins' structures are fundamentally correlated with our ability to develop potent drugs.

## Amino acids and protein primary sequences

The contents are covered by introductory texts of biochemistry. From a chemistry point of view, note that carbonyls in peptides are hydrogen bond acceptors while NHs (amides) are hydrogen bond donors.

## Secondary structure

Secondary structures are defined as regions of localized folding in the protein backbone.

Examples:

* Alpha-helix
* Beta-sheet
* Random coil
* Bend
* Turn

The quiz was to look up four PDB entries and find (1) maximum residue (amino acid) counts and (2) which molecule has the largest percentage of alpha helices.

An interesting resource introduced was [SCOP2](http://scop2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/front.html), or Structural Classification of Proteins 2. It classifies proteins with known structures by various ways, such as evolutionary relationships and structural relationships.
