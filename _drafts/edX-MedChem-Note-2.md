Chapter two gives an overview on the whole drug discovery process, from basic approaches of drug discovery to marketing.

## Target-based and phenotype-based drug discovery

## Intellectual property and patent

### Naming

### Polymorphism

## Virtual lab

Task: use [molinspiration](http://www.molinspiration.com) to design a molecule with high specificity against one type of drug targets over other types. The six types of drug targets for which a bioactivity score is predicted are:

* GPCR (ligand)
* Ion channel (modulator)
* Kinase (inhibitor)
* Nuclear receptor (ligand)
* Protease (inhibitor)
* Enzyme (inhibitor)
