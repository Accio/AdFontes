Chapter five discusses various aspects of receptors as drug targets, such as classification, ligands, and the occupancy theory.

## Receptor types

Major receptor superfamilies are introduced
* Ligand-gated ion channels
* G-protein coupled receptors
* Tyrosine kinase-linked receptors: ligand binding causes receptor dimers
* Nuclear receptors: not membrane bound and located in nucleus

## Ligands

## Occupancy theory
