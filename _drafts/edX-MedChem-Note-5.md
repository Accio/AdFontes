Chapter five discusses various aspects of receptors as drug targets, such as classification, ligands, and the occupancy theory.

## Receptor types

Major receptor superfamilies are introduced:

* Ligand-gated ion channels
* G-protein coupled receptors
* Tyrosine kinase-linked receptors: ligand binding causes receptor dimers
* Nuclear receptors: not membrane bound and located in nucleus

## Ligands

Four types of ligands:

* Full agonists, which arose full response of the receptor. Different full agonists can be compared by $\textrm{log}EC_{50}$.
* Partial agonists, which arose only partial response of the receptor. Partial agonists tend to bind to the same position as the full aognists; therefore they often compete with each other. Partial agonists may even supress the response to full agonists.
* Antagonists, the efficacy of which can be compared by $\textrm{log}IC_{50}$.
* Inverse agonists, which inhibits the constitutive activity of the receptor. Cannabinoid receptors are examples of constitutively active receptors.

Two types of antagonist, *competitive* and *noncompetitive*, are distinguished. The first type binds to the same site as the agonist, while the second type binds to an allosteric site.

## Occupancy theory
