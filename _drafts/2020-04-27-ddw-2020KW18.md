Here are the things I discovered this week that fascinates me.

## Computer science

### Mapping three decades of intellectual change in academia

The paper by Daniel Ramage *et al.* was discovered from WeChat ID [科研圈](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/r7zIR77_XGzuG-9Sa24sdQ) and the paper appears on [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01291). The authors used a statistical model to analyse dissertation abstracts to uncover the hidden relationships between academic disciplines and how they have changed over the last three decades.

An interesting question that the authors tried to address is how one scientific
field affects another, for instance computer science on genetics. To quantify
this, the authors developed a measure of *language incorporation*: which words
in each dissertation can be attributed to which source areas in academia?

About methodology: the authors associated the words in each dissertation
abstract with their most similar area by using Partially Labelled Dirichlet
Allocation (PLDA), a Bayesian statistical text mining approach developed and
published by the authors in 2011 based on earlier statistical topic models.

An interesting finding of the authors (though not necessarily surprising): among
the subjects, the highest exporting areas tend to be methodological or concern
abstract reasoning: mathematics, philosophy, computer science, and statistics.
Where as mathematics and philosophy present a fundamental form of knowledge with
direct applicability in other fields, the authors found that computer science
and statistics are coming to inhabit a similarly central role. The authors
explained their observation by that contemporary science and engineering become
ever more data driven, and therefore fields that enable the collection,
processing, and interpretation of large datasets are becoming more important.

Another interesting finding is that biological sciences still morrow more
language from other areas compared with other areas. And the split of biology is
an interesting observation. According to the authors: 'the majority of the field
of biology is now linked to reductionist approaches and applications in
medicine, while ecology and evolutionary biology has nearly split off into ...
environmental studies ... in the earth and agricultural sciences."

The authors used the example of computational biology to illustrate their points
about new fields and asymmetric flow of language between fields. I am very
fortunate to work in this new interdisciplinary area. On the other hand, I ask
myself whether it is possible, and if so, how to bring languages in biology into
other areas. Another question I have is how scientists experience the flow
between languages and methods between subjects, whether the experience is
consistent with findings from dissertation abstracts, and what are the
implications for scientific communication, including communication within the
field, communication with decision makers, and public communication. Last not
least, the method of [PLDA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2020408.2020481), a
supervised generative model, can be interesting for tagged data. 

## Drug discovery

### The discovery of Sofosbuvir

I read [an interesting story](https://med.sina.com/article_detail_103_2_75028.html) about the discovery of Sofosbuvir, the 'HCV cure' molecule by Gilead. The article was written by 嘤其鸣 and appeared first on pharmacodia.com. Interesting points include that

* There are six main genotypes of HCV. Sofosbuvir targets the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and is efficacious against all genotypes of HCV, because the Gly317-Asp318-Asp319 (GDD) triplet in HCV NS5B is conserved in all genotypes.
* Major challanges of nucleos(t)ide analogues: toxicity due to off-target effects, competition with endogeneous nucleoside metabolism, and affinity to RdRp.
* A derivative of uridine was chosen as the backbone. However, the first lead compound PSI-6130, despite its good inhibitory effect of viral replication, the PK profile was rather poor. The other lead compound PSI-6206 failed due to low bioavailability (25%), despite good tolerability and efficacy profile.
* A pro-drug approach was taken, which led to the discovery of mericitabine. It has an improved PK profile, but its efficacy is inferior to other compounds and its half life is short.
* Active metabolite of PSI-6130 was fount to be its triphosphate form, and it was further found out that the monophosphate form of PSI-6130 was good enough, because it has a long half-life and can be converted to the triphosphate form.
* Further medchem work used the prodrug approach, improved the physico-chemical properties while keeping the efficacy based on experience and known structure-activity-relationships (SAR). Animal models (rat, dog, and non-human primates) were used to determine the safety, PK and PD profile of drug candidates.
* The improved lead compound showed good safety and PD profile, was single-dosed per day, and well tolerated. However, it was found out that it was a racemic mixture. Further work showed that that the S-form was active (EC_90=0.42uM), which is sofosbuvir.

Like the story of vemurafenib, I awe at the many turn-arounds and coming-back-and-forth between molecular, cellular, and organ-and-system level work.
