I am Jitao David Zhang, a computational biologist working at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.

I work as a researcher in the field of computational biology, using biological knowledge, mathematical and statistical thinking, and informatics tools to deepen our understanding in human diseases, especially in the area of oncology, neuroscience, immune and inflammation, infectious diseases, and ophthalmology. My responsibility is to ensure the safety profile and to reveal mechanism of action of novel drug candidates.

My colleagues and I perform research both internally and by collaborating with academic and industrial partners. We regularly publish research results and methodology papers in peer-reviewed, open-access journal, as well as open-source software libraries and packages.

In my free time, I teach bachelor-level courses about applied mathematics and computational biology in drug discovery.

We seek constantly motivated and talented young students to perform cutting-edge research in industry for 6-12 months. If you are interested, please [contact me](mailto:jitao_david.zhang@roche.com) for information.
