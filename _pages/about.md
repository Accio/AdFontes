I am Jitao David Zhang, a computational biologist working at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.

I work as a researcher in the field of computational biology, using bioinformatics, statistics, and biology knowledge to ensure the safety and efficacy of novel drug candidates.

My colleagues and I perform research both internally and by collaborating with academic and industrial partners. We regularly publish research results and methodology papers in peer-reviewed journals. A curated list of my publications can be found on the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ths6zX0AAAAJ&hl=en) website.

We seek constantly motivated and talented young students to perform cutting-edge research in industry for 6-12 months. If you are interested please [contact me](mailto:jitao_david.zhang@roche.com) for information.
