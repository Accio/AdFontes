I am Jitao David Zhang, a computational biologist working at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.

I use biological knowledge, mathematical and statistical thinking, and computational tools to deepen our understanding in human diseases and to identify drug targets. I also develop multiscale-modelling approaches to study the efficacy and safety profiles of novel drug candidates.

I perform research both collaborating internally at Roche and externally with academic and industrial partners. Research results are published [in open-access papers]({{site.url}}/publications) and in the form of [open-source software]({{site.url}}/software). Besides, I [teach applied mathematics and computer science in drug discovery, supervise students and postdocs, and give public talks]({{site.url}}/education). 

I am learning to play piano. I enjoy spending time with the family. When I am
alone, I read, write, and jog.
