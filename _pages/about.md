I am Jitao David Zhang, a computational biologist working at F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.

My research focuses on identifying novel drug candidates and understanding their efficacy and safety profiles. 

To achieve this, I synthesize biological knowledge, mathematical and statistical thinking, and computational tools into multiscale-modelling approaches. 

I collaborate both internally at Roche and externally with academic and industrial partners. Results of our research are shared in [open-access papers]({{site.url}}/publications) and by [open-source software]({{site.url}}/software). 

I also [teach courses, supervise students and postdocs, and give public talks]({{site.url}}/education). 

I am learning to play piano. Besides spending time with my family, I read, write, or jog.
