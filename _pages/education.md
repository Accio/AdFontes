I see it equally important to learn new things and to share the things that I
learned. Therefore I am committed in my professional and private life to both
continuous learning and to knowledge sharing. 

I use mainly three approaches to share my knowledge:
* teaching,
* working with junior researchers including students and postdocs, and
* giving public talks.

### Teaching

In the autumn semester, I teach a undergraduate-level course series, *Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery*, at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Basel. It is given in my free time, and I get great support from both Roche colleagues, colleagues at the University of Basel, as well as the students. 

Check our the material of *Applied Mathematics and Informatics In Drug Discovery* on its website [http://AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).

In the spring semester, I tech one lecture of the course series *From Novel Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.

### Working together with junior researchers

I work regularly with junior researchers, including bachelor, master and PhD students as well as postdoc researchers. My responsibility includes supervision of short-internship up to six months, mentoring of project, thesis, and career development, and teamwork in field of computational biology and its application in drug discovery.

In addition, I exchange with informatics apprentices and high-school students by introducing the field of bioinformatics and computational biology to them and by organising short internships up to three weeks.
