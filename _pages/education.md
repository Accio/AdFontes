I see it equally important to learn new things and to share the things that I
learned. Therefore I am committed to continuous education of myself and to
knowledge sharing by teaching, by giving public talks, and by supervising students and postdoc researchers.

### Teaching

I am teaching a course series, *Applied Mathematics and Informatics in Drug Discovery*, in my free time at the Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Basel. See more about the course on the course's website, [http://AMIDD.ch](http://amidd.ch).

I am also teaching one lecture of the course series *From Novel Targets to Novel Therapeutics* on topics of computational biology and multiscale modelling at the Department of Pharmacy, University of Basel.
