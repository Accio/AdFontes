Some colleagues at Roche have organised learning and potential internship
opportunities for students or PhDs by inviting them work on challenges
associated with healthcare data. These challenges, specified on the website of
[*Healthcare Xplorers*](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/), invite bright minds
to tackle them.

* Challenge 01 - [Predicting drug effects in a multimodal biological
  network](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/predicting-drug-effects-in-a-multimodal-biological-network/);
* Challenge 02 - [Explore the future of
  sensing](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/challenges/explore-the-future-of-sensing/);
* Challenge 03 - [A deep learning-based approach for detection of neurological
  disease patterns using a draw-a-shape
  test](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/challenges/a-deep-learning-based-approach-for-detection-of-neurological-disease-patterns-using-a-draw-a-shape-test/);
* Challenge 04 - [Non-invasive liquid level
  detection](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/challenges/non-invasive-liquid-level-detection/);
* Challenge 05 - [Graph-based Bottleneck Analysis in a complex production
  environment](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/challenges/graph-based-bottleneck-analysis-in-a-complex-production-environment/).

The topics cover a wide range of drug discovery, development, diagnostics, and
production. If you are interested, apply by April the 26th via the website
above.

The selection process is similar to that for start-ups. All applications will be
first reviewed. Next, applicants with promising proposals will be invited to a
Zoom session to present their ideas (*Xplorer Camp*). Finally, the selected
candidate will negotiate how to collaborate with Roche to address the
challenge.

You cannot make the deadline? There is also a [Greenfield
challenge](https://healthcare-xplorers.com/challenges/greenfield-challenge/) for
students to submit any great ideas they would potentially want to collaborate
with Roche on.
