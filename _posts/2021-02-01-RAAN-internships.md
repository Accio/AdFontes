Are you a master or PhD student, and looking for an internship of computational
biology and bioinformatics? Are you interested in developing algorithms and
software pipelines to empower drug discovery? We offer two such positions.

* We offer a six-month internship to analyse cell-to-cell communication, using
  single-cell data and state-of-the-art computational methods. [Read more and
