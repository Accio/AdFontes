Aviv Regev is joining Roche as the head of Genentech Research and Early
Development.Here is a brief news item from [the New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/11/business/11reuters-roche-hldg-research.html).

Aviv Regev, a world-class expert in computational biology and systems biology.
She has great expertise in both biology and computer science. Before joining
Roche, she is a professor associated with the BROAD Institute of MIT, member of
the leadership team there, and associated with the Harvard University.

I envision that she will influence how drug-discovery research is conducted at
Genentech and in the whole Roche group. A sure bet is that we will increasingly
integrate experimental and computational approaches, with the hope that both
approaches informing and enhancing each other. Another sure bet is that we will
use more single-cell and multimodal techniques to characterize diseases as well
as drug candidates.

As a computational biologist, I hope that her capacity to steer
interdisciplinary research to tackle complex problems will help us better
understand diseases and identify drugs with better safety and efficacy profiles.

Congratulations and welcome, Aviv!
