[Raymond J. Deshaies, Nature,
2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2168-1) reviewed recent
development and outlook of multispecific drugs. Here are my key learnings.

## A historical perspective of multispecific drugs

The author believes that multispecific drugs are the fourth generation of drugs,
following the first wave of molecules with defined structure but undefined
molecular target, defined molecules and molecular targets, and biologics. Though
he also pointed out that many drugs that were developed work actually as
multispecific drugs, with prominent example of Tacrolimus (which interact with
both calcineurin and FKBP12), rapamycin (mTOR and FKBP12), Thalidomide (IKFZ1
and IKZF3 with CRBN). See more examples in Table 1.

## Obligate multispecific drugs

 Obligate (which means binding or biologically essential for survival)
 multispecific drugs work by engaging two or more entities so that either drug
 activity is limited at a specific location, or the target is brought into
 proximity to an endogenous effector that acts upon the target. They include
 sequentially binding obligate multispecific drugs (SOMs), concurrently binding
 obligate drugs that mediate localization (COMLs), and concurrently binding
 obligate multispecific drugs that function as matchmakers (COMMs).

* SOMs engage two or more entities (dock and target) that are in different
compartments. Examples of SOM include modified siRNA with ligands that bind the
liver-restricted asialoglycoprotein receptor, and antibody-toxin complex.
* In COML, the dock and the target reside in the same compartment. An
example is an antibody-cytokine fusion. A COML must bind both the dock and the
target simultaneously for the drug to work.
* Matchmakers work by inducing proximity. They can enhance the therapeutic
index (safety margin) by limiting its action to sites where the drug exerts its
therapeutic effect. For instance degraders.

## Matchmakers in focus
	
The author then introduced different types of matchmakers.

Small-molecule matchmakers include immunosuppressants, thalidomides, and
proteolysis-targeting chimaeras such as Heterobifunctional proteolysis-targeting
chimeric molecules (PROTACs), which contain a liganda that binds a target
coupled to another ligand that binds an ubiquitin ligase, which can lead to the
degradation of the target protein.

Biologic COMMs can link cell together, for instance bi-specific antibodies that
bind to both T cell and cancer cells (bispecific CD3 engagers, BCE for short),
or Emicizumab, a hetero-IgG that cross-links activated coagulation factor IX
(known as FIXa) and factor X (FX). It substitutes the function of factor VIII
(FVIII), which is missing in individuals with type-A haemophilia.

## Future multispecific drugs

Future multispecific drugs may better localize drugs, for instance targeted
delivery of oligonucleotides to organs other than liver, or delivery across the
blood-brain barriers. Better bispecific CD3 engagers, for instance by adding a
protease-sensitive linker, using a &lsquo;AND&rsquo logic gate, or adopting a
&lsquo;cage-key&rsquo; system where a locked antibody can be only activated in
the presence of a particular key.

Preclinical discovery and development of multispecific drugs is impeded by large
screening space, physical chemical properties, PK and safety assessment, and
lack of *in vivo* models. Beyond that, manufacture, stability, and dosing
regiments also matter. The author argues for a tighter integration between
biology, chemistry, engineering, and computer science in order to discovery and
develop more multispecific drugs.

## Conclusions

According to the author, about two thirds of the pipeline molecules through
Phase I clinical trials at Amgen are multispecific drugs. Many academic research
groups and companies are also working and investing in this area. It can be
imagined that multispecific drugs will keep us busy in the coming years. Due to
the many challenges above, I am confident that multiscale modelling and
computational biology will be vital to understand their MoA and safety profiles
with reduced or no use of animals.
