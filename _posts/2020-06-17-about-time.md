How we spend time is how we live our lives. I learned this when reading
[*Momo*](http://michaelende.de/en/book/momo-0) by Michael Ende three years ago.
It is a fantastic book that I am lucky not to have missed.

Recently I started reading [*Beschleunigung - Die Veränderung der Zeitstrukturen
in der
Moderne*](https://www.suhrkamp.de/buecher/beschleunigung-hartmut_rosa_29360.html)
(Social Acceleration: A New Theory of Modernity) by the sociologist Hartmut
Rosa. I finished the introduction and conclusion enjoyed it overall. Some
messages may be more clear if the writing style at some places is less academic
in my opinion, but this does not hamper the depth or the novelty of
the theses of the book in any way.

He argues in the book that social acceleration is the hallmark of modernity, and
acceleration calls for more acceleration, which can leave people behind and
leave different parts of the society, including nature and economy, democracy and
politics, and family and work de-synchronized. During this process, autonomous
decision making by individuals becomes more challenging and constrained because
of the pressure of acceleration.

I will try to make a summary when I finish reading the book. Until then, I share
a few things that I learned from other people about time, among others
[Seneca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Brevitate_Vitae_(Seneca)), [Paul
Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html), [Wolfgang
Herrndorf](https://www.wolfgang-herrndorf.de/), [Ruan
Yifeng](https://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2016/05/time-management.html), and
family members, friends, and colleagues. I do not know whether there are
universal truths about time. But I find the points below helped me scrutinize
how I deal with time.

1. Life is short.
1. How you spend time is how you live your life.
1. Spend time with people and things that you cherish with a sense of urgency.
1. Block time to concentrate and produce with high efficiency is limited every
   day: plan them cautiously and use them wisely.
1. Allocate and handle tasks in the order of (a) urgent and important, (b)
   important but not urgent, (c) urgent but not important, (d) not urgent and
   not important. For instance, make a table or make a Cartesian coordinate to
   visualize them.
1. Start the day with a block working time. Do not check any communication
   tools. The valuable time in the morning belongs to you, not others who write
   to you.
1. Emails, chats, and other communication tools are at its best to-do lists and
   at its worst time waste.
1. Process switching is expensive: keep a single thread and avoid multitasking
   (read: multithread-procrastination).
1. Meeting is the last resort if every other communication channel fails. The
   father of a friend put it this way: *Meetings are where minutes are kept and
   hours are lost.*
1. Things that you do not do when you are busy are likely left undone even if
   you are free. Things that you do despite being busy are things that you
   value.
1. Be aware of the preciousness of time, and share the output of spending your
   time with as many people as possible.
