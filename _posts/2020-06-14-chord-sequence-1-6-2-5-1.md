I [posted]({% post_url 2020-06-05-dw8-2020KW23 %}) about a series of fantastic courses by Karen Cuneo Ramirez about music
theory. Inspired by her, I summarize the technique introduced by her in the course [&ldquo;chord sequence 1-6-2-5-1&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdCZwxpPEZg) in a figure.

The principle can be applied to any scale (any key), and can be generalized beyond the sequence of &ldquo;1-6-2-5-1&rdquo;. If you have any question, please refer to the lesson by Karen above.

Enjoy music, enjoy the Sunday!
