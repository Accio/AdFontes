Here are the things I discovered this week that fascinates me.

## Computational biology

* [Bad News Wrapped in Protein: Inside the Coronavirus Genome](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html). A fantastic infographic about the genome of the corona virus that made the my bioinformatics heart beat faster. The starting sentence already catches my eye: *A virus is “simply a piece of bad news wrapped up in protein,” the biologists Jean and Peter Medawar wrote in 1977.*. 
* [A reference map of the human binary protein interactome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2188-x).  An ‘all-by-all’ reference interactome map of human binary protein interactions named ‘HuRI’, with approximately 53,000 protein–protein interactions.
* Reinforcement and learning: The nature paper from Google DeepMind, [A distributional code for value in dopamine-based reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1924-6), attracted a lot of attentions. An article on Current Biology provides some background information and valuable comments to the work: [Reinforcement Learning: Full Glass or Empty — Depends Who You Ask](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.02.062). Accidentally, Lei Zhang, a friend and former colleague of mine, gave an introduction to Reinforcement Learning and Bayesian Modelling in psychology in the Open Science Forum in China, with open-source codes available on Github: [lei-zhang/RL_tutorial_webinar](https://github.com/lei-zhang/RL_tutorial_webinar).
* [Dendritic cells dictate responses to PD-L1 blockade cancer immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aav7431). An interesting paper published by Roche colleagues including my team colleague Andreas about mode of action of PD-L1 antibodies for cancer immune therapy. It reveals an unexpected role of dendritic cells. Note how long it took between the manuscript submission and the appearance. Amazing!
* [TooManyCells identifies and visualizes relationships of single-cell clades](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-020-0748-5).In stead of classifying single cells into a fixed number of classes, *TooManyCells* uses a graph-based method to visualize single cells. The software code is on GitHub: https://github.com/GregorySchwartz/too-many-cells (written in Haskell!)


## Writing

This week I spent quite some time writing an essay (which will be posted here in
due time). It was both pain and fun. I definitely learned a lot, and I discover
that writing helps thinking.

There are many good tutorials about writing essays. A recent one is from Paul
Graham, [How to write usefully](http://www.paulgraham.com/useful.html). I read
most of his other essays on his website, and are impressed by a lot of them.
Books like *On Writing Well* by William Zinsser are also very helpful, too. I
read a small booklet, *How to write an essay* by Richard Aczel, accidentally
last year, and found the tips also very useful, too. Here are a few points that
I enjoyed most:

* Keep the points relevant, and address the question immediately, explicitly,
and exclusively.
* Always plan ahead.
* Don't just state, argue.
* Write in paragraphs, with topic sentence, development, illustration, and links 
between paragraphs.
* Keep the introduction and conclusion short.
* Keep the style simple, but formal. Don't generalize, exaggerate, moralize. 
Don't express opinions! (people don't care what you THINK, they care what you 
ARGUE). Don't repeat.
* Clarify fuzzy ideas and expressions.
* Practice by coming up with ideas, rewriting, reading aloud.

What surprised me: the book was read last year and I thought that must have
forgotten it completely. It took me by surprise when I realised that I actually
followed most of the points, as I discovered my book notes *after* I finished
the essay.

## Software projects

* [A linter for prose](https://github.com/amperser/proselint)
* [NextFlow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow): I tried
    [Snakemake](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake) and was very excited.
    Now I hear friends recommend NextFlow (nf), which I want to give it a try.
