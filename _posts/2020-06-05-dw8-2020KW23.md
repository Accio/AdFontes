## Drug discovery

### Drug discovery from the perspective of protein communities

I wrote a blog post [*Probing protein communities with mass spectrometry*]({%
post_url 2020-06-04-protein-communities %}) summarizing my learnings from
reading the review by Budayeva and Kirkpatrick.

## Biology

### Lessons learned from the TRACERx study

I share my learning notes [in another blog post]({% post_url
2020-05-30-TRACERx-100 %}).

### RNA-guided endonuclease editing: history and clinical testing

I share my learning notes [in another blog post]({% post_url 2020-06-05-RGENs
%}).

### Flagship studies of the Genome Aggregation Database (genomAD)

*Nature* and other journals published a series of studies reporting the results
of analysing the [Genome Aggregation Database
(genomAD)](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html). I am
now reading and digesting them.

## Programming

### 2020 Developer Survey by StackOverflow

The high-level results are summarized at the blog [*The
Overflow*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/05/27/2020-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results).
The breakdown results can be found
[here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020).

My impressions:

* I know practically nothing about the two most loved languages: Rust and
  TypeScript (well, beyond that it is typed JavaScript). I am happy that I still
  have the chance to learn some lovely languages. Apparently [Rust is
  particularly interesting for system
  programming](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/01/20/what-is-rust-and-why-is-it-so-popular/).
  Python comes as the third.
* About 70% responders are under 35. People seem to leave the field of
    programming as they age.
* People using Perl seem to earn much more (79k) than those using R or Python
    (57k and 59k). Experience and age is a confounding factor.
* Most responding people learn at least one new technologies a few months or a
  year.
* Over 80% responders are open to or interested in new job possibilities.
* It seems that programmers working in mainland China are under-represented,
    according to the number of participants and to the result of working hours.

### Tricks that I learned to work with box.com

* Uploading files to box.com: `curl -1 -v --disable-epsv --ftp-skip-pasv-ip -u
    YOURFULLEMAIL:YOURBOXPASSWORD --ftp-ssl --upload-file FILENAME
    ftp://ftp.box.com/`.
* Download files: `curl -1 -v --disable-epsv
    --ftp-skip-pasv-ip -u YOUREMAIL:YOURBOXPASSWORD --ftp-ssl
    ftp://ftp.box.com/FILENAMEONBOX -o FILENAMEONYOURLOCALFOLDER`.
* To list files, `curl -1 -v --disable-epsv --ftp-skip-pasv-ip -u
    YOUREMAIL:YOURBOXPASSWORD --ftp-ssl ftp://ftp.box.com`.

I learned them from Marco Berrera.

## Statistics and machine learning

### Core progress in AI has stalled in some fields

Hutson summarized in a short article the observation that [core progress in AI
has stalled in some fields](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-020-0066-y).
Examples include neural-network pruning algorithms, information retrieval
system, loss function in image retrieval, adversarial training with projected
gradient descent, long-short term memory (LSTM) neural networks, and generative
adversarial networks (GANs).

My interpretation is that impactful innovation happens rarely. The principle
applies in all fields of research and development. AI is not an exception.

It can be frustrating for those who aim to develop a genuinely new algorithm in
a short period of time (say PhD students) that transform how we analyse the data
and the way we model the world. It should come not as a surprise who do research
for a life and only calls for curiosity, vigilance, and resilience. It can be
encouraging for those who wait a bit and use the best model available, which is
used by many but not all people, to get the best leverage of the technology.

I guess the return of investment of either following every new algorithm and
result, or not following any, is worse compared with the wait-observe-and-invest
approach.

## Music

### Music theory explained

I discovered videos of Karen Ramirez on YouTube, for instance [How to Make
Chords from a Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt6zDOFNAdY) and [Chord
Sequence 1 -6 -2 -5 -1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdCZwxpPEZg).

Karen Ramirez is a fantastic teacher who knows how to bring messages over. She
is knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and she speak directly and explains well. I am
learning both music theory and teaching from her.

I created a [play
list](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzx9Jk87ZvDJxq3hxZ-Ju19n7oBxFmVyW)
on YouTube that contains her videos that I still need to watch.

A related resource is a video (in Chinese) about the circle of fifth, which is
available on [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/s/video/BV1Hb411j7aX). The cool
thing: even a JavaScript-implementation of the Circle of Fifths is introduced,
with the source code available at GitHub
[wiwikuan/wiwi-circleOfFifths](https://github.com/wiwikuan/wiwi-circleOfFifths).

### The fearless pianist

I enjoyed the article by Alex Ross on the *New Yorker* magazine (May 18, 2020)
on Igor Levit.

His friendship with Hannes Malte Mahler, a German artist, who died in a bicycle
accident in 2016, impressed me mostly. Levit told Alex Ross: &ldquo;Accidentally
or not, he always gave me the feeling that I am allowed to be who I am, without
explaining or apologizing. I can just be.&rdquo;

I know more than one such people in my life. I owe them all what I have.

Mahler's death shocked Levit. &ldquo;Aside from the loss, I had this sense that
I had to go on even more with that process of taking away layers, discarding
fears, letting myself be who I am. I really turned into a different person. No
more bullshit.&rdquo;

I am stunned, because I can not find a better description of my experience and
my change after Clemens Broger left us in 2017.

Another point that impressed me was Igor Levit's feelings about being onstage,
even when he was threatened because of his political standpoint. &ldquo;For me,
the stage becomes the one place of freedom, absolute freedom. Nobody is
bothering me, there are no phone calls, no interruptions. The worst thing that
can happen, the worst thing possible, is a wrong note. Also, to hell with those
people.&rdquo;

I thank Alex Ross for portraying the Levit who &lsquo;developed away from the
spotlight&rsquo;. And I appreciate that the possibility of reaching freedom Igor
Levit shows me with his music, his words, and his human being.

The article can be found on
[NewYorker.com](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/igor-levit-is-like-no-other-pianist),
under a slightly different title, *Igor Levit is Like No Other Pianist*.

A song to kiss the night goodbye: [The People United Will Never Be Defeated,
Variation 36, played by Igor
Levit](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ZAYR95RogkxQrh3kparcK?si=lWVrn9IfR5uSnEVNpJpiow).

### New music sheet shared on MuseScore

I shared a new music sheet of an old German folklore, *Ich liebe den Frühling*
(I love the spring, 我爱春天) on
[MuseScore](https://musescore.com/user/32500761/scores/6165050). I arranged the
chords as homework of my piano lessons, wrote the lyric in Chinese, and typed it
with the software [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/en). It is shared in public
domain. Anyone can reuse it.

## Other gems

* How to build a four-dimensional object in our 3D space? Connect each node to
    six neighbour nodes. What can you get? Apparently a [topological
    insulator](https://physicsworld.com/a/topological-insulators-enter-the-fourth-dimension).
* [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) is a set of online apps for mathematics,
    geometry, and more. A new software project under current development,
    [penrose](https://github.com/penrose/penrose), promises to create diagrams
    by typing mathematical notation in plain text. In a way, it is like LaTeX
    for visualization.

### Happiness and sadness, quantified

[Kettelwell *et
al.*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352827319302204)
reported in *SSM - Population Health* a cohort study of impact of major life
events, such as marriage, money gain, widowing, and separation, on cognitive and
affective well-being.

In this study, *Cognitive well-being* refers to overall life satisfaction. It
was obtained from the annual face-to-face interview using the response to the
question: &ldquo;All things considered, how satisfied are you with your
life?&rdquo;. The respondent was asked to pick a number between 0 (not
satisfied) and 10 (satisfied).

*Affective well-being* refers to the frequency and intensity with which people
experience positive affect and negative affect. It was quantified by questions
about positive and negative aspects of mental health, such as &ldquo;felt so
down in the dumps nothing could cheer me up&rdquo;, &ldquo;been happy&rdquo;),
and questions dealing with positive and negative aspects of vitality (e.g.,
&ldquo;feel full of life&rdquo;, &ldquo;felt worn out&rdquo;).

Interesting findings: against common assumptions,
promotion and being fired had little, if any, independent effect on well being,
while other events such as financial loss, death of partner, and childbirth have
profound impacts. Either positive or negative, the effect of most events wane
after two to four years time.

I think we have to interpret the data cautiously. For instance, it was reported
that the death of friends, on average, has little effect. The effect, though,
may between friends dramatically, because &lsquo;friends&rsquo; is a broad
category of people that we interact with.

Nevertheless, the findings remind us how to make better decisions about what to
invest in and spend time on. Family members and other loved ones, wealth ([not
money or status](https://nav.al/rich)), and health would, unsurprisingly,
enrich the life of most people.

### No-bullshit design thinking

1. Listen to what people *want* and make customer become the *king*.
1. The team defines *together* before creating anything.
1. Gather *ideas* how to implement a minimalistic product.
1. Build a *prototype* to show it to the team members and the customer.
1. Make people *test* the prototype and *iterate* and *refine*.

The five steps are also known as *Empathize*, *Define*, *Ideate*, *Prototype*,
*Test*.

Happy weekend!
