title: Bioinformatics approaches to understanding the MoA of a compound
category: drug-discovery
---

In March 2019, I was invited by Dr. Adrian Roth to give a lecture about bioinformatics approaches to understanding the MoA of a compound to master students of pharmacy in the course series of *From Novel Targets To Novel Therapeutic Modalities* at the University of Basel.

The slide deck of the lecture can be downloaded below.

The key messages I tried to deliver are three-fold.

1. In drug discovery, we are often interested in multiple levels of working mechanism - molecular, cellular/omics, and system/organ-level - of drug candidates.
2. Bioinformatics modelling and relevant fields including molecular modelling, PK/PD modelling, combined with statistical modelling, build the computational foundation of MoA understanding.
3. MoA understanding is an interdisciplinary effort and can be a long process. Many techniques are required that are either applicable to all modalities (small-molecule, antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, *etc.*) and or specifically designed for individual modality.

I am convinced that computational approaches, partially supporting and partially complementary to experimental approaches, have been and will remain critical in understanding mechanism and safety of drug candidates in drug discovery. And I argue for an interdisciplinary view of mechanism and safety understanding of drug candidates. More thoughts about that will follow soon.
