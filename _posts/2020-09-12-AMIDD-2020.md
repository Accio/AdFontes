One more week to go: on September 18<sup>th</sup>, 2020, the course *Applied Mathematics
and Informatics In Drug Discovery* (AMIDD) will run again at the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Basel.

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the course in the fall semester 2020 will take
place online with Zoom. Please follow the instructions on the course's website,
[http://amidd.ch](http://amidd.ch), to register for the Zoom meetings. Both
students who want to take credits and auditors are welcome.

Having taught both class-room and virtual courses before, I am aware that both
formats have advantages and disadvantages. Since this semester will be the first
time that I teach the AMIDD course virtually, I do not expect everything runs
smoothly. I will try to make the best of the situation and learn along the way
how to best help and support the students to learn together.

In the AMIDD course, we focus on interdisciplinary research in drug discovery
with mathematics as the language and informatics as the tool. More information
on the course can be found [at the course directory of the University
Basel](https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/de/recherche?id=251981). And if
you want to get an impression of the course, [the archived page of the 2019
semester](https://accio.github.io/AMIDD/archive/README-2019.html) may be of
help.
