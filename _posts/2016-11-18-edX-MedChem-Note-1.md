I follow course [DavidsonX: D001x Medicinal Chemistry](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DavidsonX+D001x+1T2016/info) on edX. Here are the notes.

# 7-week course plan

* Week 1: History of drug dicovery (DD hereafter)
* Week 2: Drug targets
* Week 3: Pharmacokinetics (PK)
* Week 4: Drug metabolism
* Week 5: Druggable genes
* Week 6: Lead discovery
* Week 7: Lead optimisation

# Chapter 1: Pre-regulatory medicine

Ephedrine (_stimulant_, _vasoconstrictor_) from Ma Huang is an alkaloid.

[Structure of Ephedrine, from Wiki]: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephedrin#/media/File:(-)-Ephedrin.svg "Structure of Ephedrine"

Phenethylamines (_neurotransmitter_) can give a big class of drugs. It is considered as a _pharmacophore_, which is the minimal portion of a structure that is required to maintain a level of activity.

Its derivatives include Pseudoephedrine (_Sudafed_, _decongestant_), which can be converted to methamphetamine (crystal meth). Another derivative is fenfluramine.

Some related conceptsi on [adverse effects](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:DavidsonX+D001x+1T2016/courseware/884c01af81dc4010b0561ced9e78d3ef/1039fdbc0da443569728ef5da331caed/?child=last):
* ADR (adverse drug reaction) warrants either alteration of the drug's dosage or halting administration of the drug.
* Adverse effect: same as an adverse drug reaction but not limited to drugs
* Adverse event: a negative outcome observed during the use of a drug but not necessarility caused by the drug. If indeed caused by thde drug, the adverse event will be re-classified as an ADR.
* Side effect: non-clinical term associated with effects that are caused by a drug and yet seemingly unrelated to a drug's intended therapeutic effect.

In the examples section, opiates, oploids, and the morphine rule is introduced.

Fluorine atoms are commonly encountered in drugs, because they can make a molecule more inert to the body's metabolic reactions, therefore causing a lower rate of metabolism.
