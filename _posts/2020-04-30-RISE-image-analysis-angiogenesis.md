---

We offer an six-month internship for PhD students on the topic of image data
analysis and modelling.

## What is a RISE studentship?

My company (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd) offers graduate students an industrial
internship programme, known as RISE, or Roche Internship for Scientific
Exchange. 

The key idea is that PhD students who are about to finish their thesis
can join the industry for a short period of time (usually 6 months) to gain
first-hand experience in industrial research.

## About this position

Here is a detailed description of the position that my colleagues and I are now
posting: [Roche Careers
Website](https://www.roche.com/careers/jobs/jobsearch/job.htm?id=E-202003-109025).
You can also apply there.

We are seeking for a motivated PhD researcher to develop and apply an advanced
image processing workflow to analyse and model high-content screening data from
complex angiogenesis assays. 

The student will work with both wet-lab scientists and *in silico* data
modelling and machine learning experts. If you are a PhD student in the field of
computational biology, statistics, machine learning and in particular image
processing, this position may be interesting for you. If you are curious about
or interested in learning how industrial research is performed, this is an
outstanding opportunity.
